abstract = {In this Letter, we show that the explosive percolation is a novel continuous phase transition. The order-parameter-distribution histogram at the percolation threshold is studied in Erdos-R{\'{e}}nyi networks, scale-free networks, and square lattice. In finite system, two well-defined Gaussian-like peaks coexist, and the valley between the two peaks is suppressed with the system size increasing. This finite-size effect always appears in typical first-order phase transition. However, both of the two peaks shift to zero point in a power law manner, which indicates the explosive percolation is continuous in the thermodynamic limit. The nature of explosive percolation in all the three structures belongs to this novel continuous phase transition. Various scaling exponents concerning the order-parameter-distribution are obtained. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An introductory review of various concepts about first-order phase transitions is given. Rules for classification of phase transitions as second or first order are discussed, as well as exceptions to these rules. Attention is drawn to the rounding of first-order transitions due to finite-size or quenched impurities. Computational methods to calculate phase diagrams for simple model Hamiltonians are also described. Particular emphasis is laid on metastable states near first-order phase transitions, on the 'stability limits' of such states (e.g. the 'spinodal curve' of the gas-liquid transition) and on the dynamic mechanisms by which metastable states decay (nucleation and growth of droplets of a new phase, etc).},

@article{Radicchi2017,
abstract = {Two important problems regarding spreading phenomena in complex topologies are the optimal selection of node sets either to minimize or maximize the extent of outbreaks. Both problems are nontrivial when a small fraction of the nodes in the network can be used to achieve the desired goal. The minimization problem is equivalent to a structural optimization. The "superblockers," i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to minimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components as small as possible. "Superspreaders" are instead the nodes such that, if chosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity of superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on the specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the two optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers act also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking importance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world networks to test the similarity between sets of superblockers and of superspreaders. We show that the two optimization problems are not equivalent: superblockers do not act as optimal spreaders.},

@article{Perline2005a,
abstract = {Pareto, Zipf and numerous subsequent investigators of inverse power distributions have often represented their findings as though their data conformed to a power law form for all ranges of the variable of interest. I refer to this ideal case as a strong inverse power law (SIPL). However, many of the examples used by Pareto and Zipf, as well as others who have followed them, have been truncated data sets, and if one looks more carefully in the lower range of values that was originally excluded, the power law behavior usually breaks down at some point. This breakdown seems to fall into two broad cases, called here (1) weak and (2) false inverse power laws (WIPL and FIPL, resp.). Case 1 refers to the situation where the sample data fit a distribution that has an approximate inverse power form only in some upper range of values. Case 2 refers to the situation where a highly truncated sample from certain exponential-type (and in particular, "lognormal-like") distributions can convincingly mimic a power law. The main objectives of this paper are (a) to show how the discovery of Pareto-Zipf-type laws is closely associated with truncated data sets; (b) to elaborate on the categories of strong, weak and false inverse power laws; and (c) to analyze FIPLs in some detail. I conclude that many, but not all, Pareto-Zipf examples are likely to be FIPL finite mixture distributions and that there are few genuine instances of SIPLs.},

A static framework is used, with adjacency matrix playing the role of the dynamical variable. Hence, our model is a matrix model, where matrices are random, but their elements take values 0 and 1 only. Confusion present in some papers where earlier attempts to incorporate transitivity in a similar framework have been made is hopefully dissipated. Inspired by more conventional matrix models, new analytic techniques to develop a static model with non-trivial clustering are introduced. Computer simulations complete the analytic discussion.},

@article{Barrat2008,
abstract = {The field of complex networks is one of the most active areas in contemporary statistical physics. Ten years after seminal work initiated the modern study of networks, interest in the field is in fact still growing, as indicated by the ever increasing number of publications in network science. The reason for such a resounding success is most likely the simplicity and broad significance of the approach that, through graph theory, allows researchers to address a variety of different complex systems within a common framework. This special issue comprises a selection of contributions presented at the workshop 'Complex Networks: from Biology to Information Technology' held in July 2007 in Pula (Cagliari), Italy as a satellite of the general conference STATPHYS23. The contributions cover a wide range of problems that are currently among the most important questions in the area of complex networks and that are likely to stimulate future research. The issue is organised into four sections. The first two sections describe 'methods' to study the structure and the dynamics of complex networks, respectively. After this methodological part, the issue proceeds with a section on applications to biological systems. The issue closes with a section concentrating on applications to the study of social and technological networks. The first section, entitled Methods: The Structure, consists of six contributions focused on the characterisation and analysis of structural properties of complex networks: The paper Motif-based communities in complex networks by Arenas et al is a study of the occurrence of characteristic small subgraphs in complex networks. These subgraphs, known as motifs, are used to define general classes of nodes and their communities by extending the mathematical expression of the Newman–Girvan modularity. The same line of research, aimed at characterising network structure through the analysis of particular subgraphs, is explored by Bianconi and Gulbahce in Algorithm for counting large directed loops. This work proposes a belief-propagation algorithm for counting long loops in directed networks, which is then applied to networks of different sizes and loop structure. In The anatomy of a large query graph, Baeza-Yates and Tiberi show that scale invariance is present also in the structure of a graph derived from query logs. This graph is determined not only by the queries but also by the subsequent actions of the users. The graph analysed in this study is generated by more than twenty million queries and is less sparse than suggested by previous studies. A different class of networks is considered by Traven{\c{c}}olo and da F Costa in Hierarchical spatial organisation of geographical networks. This work proposes a hierarchical extension of the polygonality index as a means to characterise geographical planar networks and, in particular, to obtain more complete information about the spatial order of the network at progressive spatial scales. The paper Border trees of complex networks by Villas Boas et al focuses instead on the statistical properties of the boundary of graphs, constituted by the vertices of degree one (the leaves of border trees). The authors study the local properties, the depth, and the number of leaves of these border trees, finding that in some real networks more than half of the nodes belong to the border trees. The last contribution to the first section is The generation of random directed networks with prescribed 1-node and 2-node degree correlations by Zamora-L{\'{o}}pez et al. This study deals with the generation of random directed networks and shows that often a large number of links cannot be 'randomised' without altering the degree correlations. This permits fast generation of ensembles of maximally random networks. In the section Methods: The Dynamics, significant attention is given to the study of synchronisation processes on networks: D{\'{i}}az-Guilera's contribution Dynamics towards synchronisation in hierarchical networks consists of an overview of recent studies on hierarchical networks of phase oscillators. By analysing the evolution of the synchronous dynamics, one can infer details about the underlying network topology. Thus a connection between the dynamical and topological properties of the system is established. The paper Network synchronisation: optimal and pessimal scale-free topologies by Donetti et al explores an optimisation algorithm to study the properties of optimally synchronisable unweighted networks with scale-free degree distribution. It is shown that optimisation leads to a tendency towards disassortativity while networks that are optimally 'un-synchronisable' have a highly assortative string-like structure. The paper Critical line in undirected Kauffman Boolean networks—the role of percolation by Fronczak and Fronczak demonstrates that the percolation underlying the process of damage spreading impacts the position of the critical line in random boolean networks. The critical line results from the fact that the ordered behaviour of small clusters shields the chaotic behaviour of the giant component. In Impact of the updating scheme on stationary states of networks, Radicchi et al explore an interpolation between synchronous and asynchronous updating in a one-dimensional chain of Ising spins to locate a phase transition between phases with an absorbing and a fluctuating stationary state. The properties of attractors in the yeast cell-cycle network are also shown to depend sensitively on the updating mode. As this last contribution shows, a large part of the theoretical activity in the field can be applied to the study of biological systems. The section Biological Applications brings together the following contributions: In Applying weighted network measures to microarray distance matrices, Ahnert et al present a new approach to the analysis of weighted networks, which provides a generalisation to any network measure defined on unweighted networks. The clustering coefficient constructed using this approach is used to identify a number of biologically significant genes in data sets from microarray experiments. The paper Quantifying the taxonomic diversity in real species communities by Caretta Cartozo et al reports on universal statistical properties in taxonomic trees. The results, which are obtained by sampling a large pool of species from all over the world, suggest that it is possible to quantitatively distinguish real species assemblage from random collections. In the contribution Insights into biological information processing: structural and dynamical analysis of a human protein signalling network, de la Fuente et al investigate the dynamical properties of a human protein signalling network while accounting for edge directionality and topological properties both at the local and global scale. The relationship between the node degrees and the distribution of signals through the network is characterised using degree correlation profiles. A study of a brain network is presented by de Vico Fallani et al in Persistent patterns of interconnection in time-varying cortical networks estimated from high-resolution EEG recordings in humans during a simple motor act. The authors introduce an approach based on the estimate of time-varying graph indexes that allows the capture of schemes of communication within the network. The method is applied to a set of high resolution EEG data recorded from a group of subjects performing a simple foot movement. The last section, devoted to Social and Technological Applications, includes nine contributions in the broad area of infrastructure, economic, and social systems: The paper Uncovering individual and collective human dynamics from mobile phone records by C{\'{a}}ndia et al explores extensive phone records resolved in both time and space to study collective behaviour and the occurrence of anomalous events. At the individual level, it is shown that the distribution of time intervals between consecutive calls is heavy tailed, which agrees with results previously reported on other human activities. In Mining the inner structure of the Web graph, Donato et al present a series of measurements of the Web, which offer a better understanding of the individual components of its bow-tie structure. The scale-free properties permeate all bow-tie components although they do not exhibit self-similarity and their inner structure is quite distinct. Effects of network topology on wealth distributions, by Garlaschelli and Loffredo, shows that a networked economic system self-organises towards a stationary state whose associated wealth distribution depends crucially on the underlying interaction network. In particular, this study implies that first-order topological properties alone (such as the scale-free property) are not enough to explain the emergence of the empirically observed mixed form of the wealth distribution. In the paper Resource allocation pattern in infrastructure networks, Kim and Motter show that real communication and transportation networks tend to exhibit larger load-to-capacity ratio in nodes and links with larger capacities. This surprising pattern, which is a consequence of decentralised evolution and network traffic fluctuations, suggests that infrastructure networks have evolved to prevent local failures but not necessarily large-scale failures that can be caused by cascading processes. The paper Consensus formation on coevolving networks: groups' formation and structure by Kozma and Barrat addresses the effect of adaptivity on a social model of opinion dynamics and consensus formation. The authors find that on adaptive networks the rewiring process fosters group formation by enhancing communication between agents of similar opinion, though it also makes possible the division of clusters. This result is significantly different from the percolation phenomena observed to govern the process in static networks. Capocci and Caldarelli, in the paper Fol},

Conditioning on being on a cycle, we provide the DSCL over ensembles of configuration model networks with degree distributions which follow a Poisson distribution (Erdos-R{\'{e}}nyi network), degenerate distribution (random regular graph), and a power-law distribution (scale-free network).

abstract = {Debate over the impact of team composition on the outcome of a contest has attracted sports enthusiasts and sports scientists for years. A commonly held belief regarding team success is the superstar effect; that is, including more talent improves the performance of a team1. However, studies of team sports have suggested that previous relations and shared experiences among team members improve the mutual understanding of individual habits, techniques and abilities and therefore enhance team coordination and strategy2–9. We explored the impact of within-team relationships on the outcome of competition between sports teams. Relations among teammates consist of two aspects: qualitative and quantitative. While quantitative aspects measure the number of times two teammates collaborated, qualitative aspects focus on ‘prior shared success'; that is, whether teamwork succeeded or failed. We examined the association between qualitative team interactions and the probability of winning using historical records from professional sports—basketball in the National Basketball Association, football in the English Premier League, cricket in the Indian Premier League and baseball in Major League Baseball—and the multiplayer online battle game Defense of the Ancients 2. Our results show that prior shared success between team members significantly improves the odds of the team winning in all sports beyond the talents of individuals.},

We use the probability flow of random walks on a network as a proxy for information flows in the real system and decompose the network into modules by compressing a descrip- tion of the probability flow. The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relation- ships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of {\textgreater}6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the net- work of science. Along the backbone of the network—including physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine—information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences.},

In the first part, the order parameter probability distribution and its fourth-order cumulant is discussed for thermally driven first-order transitions (the 3-state Potts model in d=3 dimensions is treated as an example). First-order transitions are characterized by a minimum of the cumulant, which gets very deep for large enough systems.

Several existing complex network models as well as real-world networks of scientific collaborations and Internet traffic are numerically investigated, and the network performance is quantitatively measured by the average inverse geodesic length and the size of the largest connected subgraph. For each case of attacks on vertices and edges, four different attacking strategies are used: removals by the descending order of the degree and the betweenness centrality, calculated for either the initial network or the current network during the removal procedure. It is found that the removals by the recalculated degrees and betweenness centralities are often more harmful than the attack strategies based on the initial network, suggesting that the network structure changes as important vertices or edges are removed. Furthermore, the correlation between the betweenness centrality and the degree in complex networks is studied.},

abstract = {The effects of internal noise in mesoscopic chemical oscillation systems have been studied analytically, in the parameter region close to the deterministic Hopf bifurcation. Starting from chemical Langevin equations, stochastic normal form equations are obtained, governing the evolution of the radius and phase of the stochastic oscillation. By stochastic averaging, the normal form equation can be solved analytically. Stationary distributions of the radius and auto-correlation functions of the phase variable are obtained. It is shown that internal noise can induce oscillation; even no deterministic oscillation exists. The radius of the noise-induced oscillation (NIO) becomes larger when the internal noise increases, but the correlation time becomes shorter. The trade-off between the strength and regularity of the NIO leads to a clear maximum in its signal-to-noise ratio when the internal noise changes, demonstrating the occurrence of internal noise coherent resonance. Since the intensity of the internal noise is inversely proportional to the system size, the phenomenon also indicates the existence of an optimal system size. These theoretical results are applied to a circadian clock system and excellent agreement with the numerical results is obtained.},

We show that the proposed measure can be applied to all types of network topology with ease and increases with the diversity of node degrees in the network. The measure is applied to compute the heterogeneity of synthetic (both random and scale free) and real world networks with its value normalized in the interval [0, 1]. To define the measure, we introduce a limiting network whose heterogeneity can be expressed analytically with the value tending to 1 as the size of the network N tends to infinity. We numerically study the variation of heterogeneity for random graphs (as a function of p and N) and for scale free networks with and N as variables. Finally, as a specific application, we show that the proposed measure can be used to compare the heterogeneity of recurrence networks constructed from the time series of several low dimensional chaotic attractors9thereby providing a single index to compare the structural complexity of chaotic attractors.},

Based on the typical number of moves required to transpose a given configuration of chess pieces into another, we conclude that the state space consists of several pockets between which transitions are rare. Skilled players explore an even smaller subset of positions that populate some of these pockets only very sparsely. These results suggest that the usual measures to estimate both, the size of the state space and the size of the tree of legal moves, are not unique indicators of the complexity of the game, but that topological considerations are equally important.},

Of particular interest are power law random graphs in which the number of vertices of degree k is proportional to 1/k$\beta$ for some fixed exponent $\beta$. For the case of $\beta$ {\textgreater} 3, we prove that the average distance of the power law graphs is almost surely of order log n/log d̃. However, many Internet, social, and citation networks are power law graphs with exponents in the range 2 {\textless} $\beta$ {\textless} 3 for which the power law random graphs have average distance almost surely of order log log n, but have diameter of order log n (provided having some mild constraints for the average distance and maximum degree). In particular, these graphs contain a dense subgraph, which we call the core, having nc/log log n vertices. Almost all vertices are within distance log log n of the core although there are vertices at distance log n from the core.},

abstract = {Nervous systems are information processing networks that evolved by natural selection, whereas very large scale integrated (VLSI) computer circuits have evolved by commercially driven technology development. Here we follow historic intuition that all physical information processing systems will share key organizational properties, such as modularity, that generally confer adaptivity of function. It has long been observed that modular VLSI circuits demonstrate an isometric scaling relationship between the number of processing elements and the number of connections, known as Rent's rule, which is related to the dimensionality of the circuit's interconnect topology and its logical capacity. We show that human brain structural networks, and the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans, also obey Rent's rule, and exhibit some degree of hierarchical modularity. We further show that the estimated Rent exponent of human brain networks, derived from MRI data, can explain the allometric scaling relations between gray and white matter volumes across a wide range of mammalian species, again suggesting that these principles of nervous system design are highly conserved. For each of these fractal modular networks, the dimensionality of the interconnect topology was greater than the 2 or 3 Euclidean dimensions of the space in which it was embedded. This relatively high complexity entailed extra cost in physical wiring: although all networks were economically or cost-efficiently wired they did not strictly minimize wiring costs. Artificial and biological information processing systems both may evolve to optimize a trade-off between physical cost and topological complexity, resulting in the emergence of homologous principles of economical, fractal and modular design across many different kinds of nervous and computational networks.},

Thus we have proposed a tabu search algorithm to optimize the structural robustness of a given network by rewiring the links and fixing the node degrees. The objective of our algorithm is to maximize a new structural robustness measure, natural connectivity, which provides a sensitive and reliable measure of the structural robustness of complex networks and has lower computation complexity. We initially applied this method to several networks with different degree distributions for contrast analysis and investigated the basic properties of the optimal network. We discovered that the optimal network based on the power-law degree distribution exhibits a roughly "eggplant-like" topology, where there is a cluster of high-degree nodes at the head and other low-degree nodes scattered across the body of "eggplant". Additionally, the cost to rewire links in practical applications is considered; therefore, we optimized this method by employing the assortative rewiring strategy and validated its efficiency.},

abstract = {Percolation is perhaps the simplest example of a process exhibiting a phase transition and one of the most studied phenomena in statistical physics. The percolation transition is continuous if sites/bonds are occupied independently with the same probability. However, alternative rules for the occupation of sites/bonds might affect the order of the transition. A recent set of rules proposed by Achlioptas et al. [ Science 323 , 1453 (2009)], characterized by competitive link addition, was claimed to lead to a discontinuous connectedness transition, named "explosive percolation". In this work we survey a numerical study of the explosive percolation transition on various types of graphs, from lattices to scale-free networks, and show the consistency of these results with recent analytical work showing that the transition is actually continuous.},

abstract = {The distribution function P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}L{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}(s) of the local order parameters in finite blocks of linear dimension L is studied for Ising lattices of dimensionality d=2, 3 and 4. Apart from the case where the block is a subsystem of an infinite lattice, also the distribution in finite systems with free [P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}L{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}(f){\textless}/sup{\textgreater}(s)] and periodic [P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}L{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}(p)(s){\textless}/sup{\textgreater}] boundary conditions is treated. Above the critical point T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, these distributions tend for large L towards the same gaussian distribution centered around zero block magnetization, while below T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} these distributions tend towards two gaussians centered at ±M, where M is the spontaneous magnetization appearing in the infinite systems. However, below T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} the wings of the distribution at small |s| are distinctly nongaussian, reflecting two-phase coexistence. Hence the distribution functions can be used to obtain the interface tension between ordered phases. At criticality, the distribution functions tend for large L towards scaled universal forms, though dependent on the boundary conditions. These scaling functions are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations. For subsystem-blocks, good agreement with previous renormalization group work of Bruce is obtained. As an application, it is shown that Monte Carlo studies of critical phenomena can be improved in several ways using these distribution functions:(i) standard estimates of order parameter, susceptibility, interface tension are improved (ii) T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} can be estimated independent of critical exponent estimates (iii) A Monte Carlo "renormalization group" similar to Nightingale's phenomenological renormalization is proposed, which yields fairly accurate exponent estimates with rather moderate effort (iv) Information on coarse-grained hamiltonians can be gained, which is particularly interesting if the method is extended to more general Hamiltonians. {\textcopyright} 1981 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The invulnerability of complex networks is an important issue in that the behavior of scale-free network differs from that of exponential network. According to the structural characteristics of the networks, we propose two new attack strategies named IDB (initial degree and betweenness) and RDB (recalculated degree and betweenness). The strategies are originated from ID (initial degree distribution) and RD (recalculated degree distribution) strategies in which attacks are based on initial structural information of a network. The probability of node removals depends on a new metric combining degree centrality and betweenness centrality. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed strategies on one real-world network and three network models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategies are more efficient than the traditional ID and RD strategies. Specially, the WS small-world network behaves more sensitive to the proposed strategies. The attack efficiency of RDB strategy is improved by 20{\%} to RD strategy, and IDB strategy is improved by 40{\%} to ID strategy.},

abstract = {We study the betweenness centrality of fractal and nonfractal scale-free network models as well as real networks. We show that the correlation between degree and betweenness centrality C of nodes is much weaker in fractal network models compared to nonfractal models. We also show that nodes of both fractal and nonfractal scale-free networks have power-law betweenness centrality distribution P(C)similar to C-delta. We find that for nonfractal scale-free networks delta=2, and for fractal scale-free networks delta=2-1/d(B), where d(B) is the dimension of the fractal network. We support these results by explicit calculations on four real networks: pharmaceutical firms (N=6776), yeast (N=1458), WWW (N=2526), and a sample of Internet network at the autonomous system level (N=20566), where N is the number of nodes in the largest connected component of a network. We also study the crossover phenomenon from fractal to nonfractal networks upon adding random edges to a fractal network. We show that the crossover length center dot(*), separating fractal and nonfractal regimes, scales with dimension d(B) of the network as p(B)(-1/d), where p is the density of random edges added to the network. We find that the correlation between degree and betweenness centrality increases with p.},

abstract = {A region of two-dimensional space has been filled randomly with a large number of growing circular disks allowing only a "slight" overlapping among them just before their growth stops. More specifically, each disk grows from a nucleation center that is selected at a random location within the uncovered region. The growth rate $\delta$ is a continuously tunable parameter of the problem which assumes a specific value while a particular pattern of disks is generated. When a growing disk overlaps for the first time with at least one other disk, its growth is stopped and is said to be frozen. In this paper we study the percolation properties of the set of frozen disks. Using numerical simulations we present evidence for the following: (i) The order parameter appears to jump discontinuously at a certain critical value of the area coverage; (ii) the width of the window of the area coverage needed to observe a macroscopic jump in the order parameter tends to vanish as $\delta$→0; and on the contrary (iii) the cluster size distribution has a power-law-decaying functional form. While the first two results are the signatures of a discontinuous transition, the third result is indicative of a continuous transition. Therefore we refer to this transition as a sharp but continuous transition similar to what has been observed in the recently introduced Achlioptas process of explosive percolation. It is also observed that in the limit of $\delta$→0, the critical area coverage at the transition point tends to unity, implying that the limiting pattern is space filling. In this limit, the fractal dimension of the pore space at the percolation point has been estimated to be 1.42(10) and the contact network of the disk assembly is found to be a scale-free network. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

However, in spite of the enthusiastic rhetoric about the so called wisdom of crowds, unsubstantiated rumors – as alternative explanation to main stream versions of complex phenomena – find on the Web a natural medium for their dissemination. In this work we study, on a sample of 1.2 million of individuals, how information related to very distinct narratives – i.e. main stream scientific and alternative news – are consumed on Facebook. Through a thorough quantitative analysis, we show that distinct communities with similar information consumption patterns emerge around distinctive narratives. Moreover, consumers of alternative news (mainly conspir- acy theories) result to be more focused on their contents, while scientific news consumers are more prone to comment on alternative news. We conclude our analysis testing the response of this social system to 4709 troll information – i.e. parodistic imitation of alternative and conspiracy theories. We find that, despite the false and satirical vein of news, usual consumers of conspiracy news are the most prone to interact with them.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of two relatively different spanning trees of complex networks, so-called "communication kernel" and "response network". First, for the communication kernel, we construct spanning trees carrying a maximum total weight of edges that is given by average traffic, which is defined as edge betweenness centrality. It is found that the resulting spanning tree plays an important role in communication between vertices. We also find that the degree distribution of spanning trees shows scale-free behavior for many model and real-world networks and the degree of the spanning trees has strong correlation with their original network topology. For the response network, we launch an attack on a single vertex which can drastically change the communication pattern between vertices of networks. By using minimum spanning tree technique, we construct the response network based on the measurement of the betweenness centrality changes due to a vertex removal. We find that the degree distribution of the response network indicates the scale-free behavior as well as that of the communication kernel. Interestingly, these two minimum spanning trees from different methods not only have same scale-free behavior but overlap each other in their structures. This fact indicates that the complex network has a concrete skeleton, scale-free tree, as a basic structure.},

abstract = {To comprehend the hierarchical organization of large integrated systems, we introduce the hierarchical map equation, which reveals multilevel structures in networks. In this information-theoretic approach, we exploit the duality between compression and pattern detection; by compressing a description of a random walker as a proxy for real flow on a network, we find regularities in the network that induce this system-wide flow. Finding the shortest multilevel description of the random walker therefore gives us the best hierarchical clustering of the network--the optimal number of levels and modular partition at each level--with respect to the dynamics on the network. With a novel search algorithm, we extract and illustrate the rich multilevel organization of several large social and biological networks. For example, from the global air traffic network we uncover countries and continents, and from the pattern of scientific communication we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in four major disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth sciences, and social sciences. In general, we find shallow hierarchical structures in globally interconnected systems, such as neural networks, and rich multilevel organizations in systems with highly separated regions, such as road networks.},

abstract = {An unexpected recognition of fractal topology in some real-world scale-free networks has evoked again an interest in the mechanisms stimulating their evolution. To explain this phenomenon a few models of a deterministic construction as well as a probabilistic growth controlled by a tunable parameter have been proposed so far. A quite different approach based on the fully stochastic evolution of the fractal scale-free networks presented in this Letter counterpoises these former ideas. It is argued that the diffusive evolution of the network on the Cayley tree shapes its fractality, self-similarity and the branching number criticality without any control parameter. The last attribute of the scale-free network is an intrinsic property of the skeleton, a special type of spanning tree which determines its fractality. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In social networks, the collective behavior of large populations can be shaped by a small set of influencers through a cascading process induced by "peer pressure". For large-scale networks, efficient identification of multiple influential spreaders with a linear algorithm in threshold models that exhibit a first-order transition still remains a challenging task. Here we address this issue by exploring the collective influence in general threshold models of behavior cascading. Our analysis reveals that the importance of spreaders is fixed by the subcritical paths along which cascades propagate: the number of subcritical paths attached to each spreader determines its contribution to global cascades. The concept of subcritical path allows us to introduce a linearly scalable algorithm for massively large-scale networks. Results in both synthetic random graphs and real networks show that the proposed method can achieve larger collective influence given same number of seeds compared with other linearly scalable heuristic approaches.},

This basic eigenvalue (or scaling) exponent condition can also be derived phenomenologically by various arguments not depending on detailed renormalization-group considerations.

We study the queuing model of an agent trying to execute a task of interest, the priority of which may vary with time due to the agent's "state of mind." However, its execution is disrupted by other tasks of random priorities. By considering the priority of the task of interest either decreasing or increasing algebraically in time, we analytically obtain and numerically confirm the bimodal and unimodal waiting time distributions with power-law decaying tails, respectively. These results are also compared to the updating time distribution of papers in the arXiv.org and the processing time distribution of papers in Physical Review journals. Our analysis helps to understand human task execution in a more realistic scenario.},

abstract = {Understanding what types of phenomena lead to discontinuous phase transitions in the connectivity of random networks is an outstanding challenge. Here we show that a simple stochastic model of graph evolution leads to a discontinuous percolation transition and we derive the underlying mechanism responsible: growth by overtaking. Starting from a collection of n isolated nodes, potential edges chosen uniformly at random from the complete graph are examined one at a time while a cap, k, on the maximum allowed component size is enforced. Edges whose addition would exceed k can be simply rejected provided the accepted fraction of edges never becomes smaller than a function which decreases with k as g(k) = 1/2 + (2k)−$\beta$. We show that if $\beta$ {\textless} 1 it is always possible to reject a sampled edge and the growth in the largest component is dominated by an overtaking mechanism leading to a discontinuous transition. If $\beta$ {\textgreater} 1, once k ≥ n1/$\beta$, there are situations when a sampled edge must be accepted leading to direct growth dominated by stochastic fluctuations and a "weakly" discontinuous transition. We also show that the distribution of component sizes and the evolution of component sizes are distinct from those previously observed and show no finite-size effects for the range of $\beta$ studied.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

Regulatory processes are often as important as the more intensively studied Hebbian processes in determining the consequences of synaptic plasticity for network function. Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. We review three of them-synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic redistribution-and discuss their functional implications.},

A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

We demonstrate its efficiency on the European electricity system and on the Internet as well as on complex networks models. We show that with small changes in the network structure (low cost) the robustness of diverse networks can be improved dramatically whereas their functionality remains unchanged.

It is defined as the sum, over pairs of vertices other than v, of the proportions of shortest paths that pass through v. In this paper, we study the distribution of the betweenness centrality in random trees and related, subcritical graph families. Specifically, we prove that the betweenness centrality of the root vertex in a simply generated tree is usually of linear order, but has a mean of order n3/2. We also show that a randomly chosen vertex typically also has linear-order betweenness centrality, and that the maximum betweenness centrality in a simply generated tree is of order n2. We obtain limiting distributions for the betweenness centrality of the root vertex and of a randomly chosen vertex, as well as for the maximum betweenness centrality, and we also show that the centroid has positive probability in the limit to be the vertex of maximum betweenness centrality. Some similar results also hold for subcritical graph classes, which will be briefly discussed. Finally, we study random recursive trees and other families of increasing trees, where the situation is quite different: here, the root betweenness centrality is of quadratic order, as is the maximum betweenness centrality. The betweenness centrality of a random vertex, on the other hand, is again of linear order. Again, we also have limiting distributions upon suitable normalisation.},

A general evolutionary mechanism based on global stability has been proposed recently J I Perotti, O V Billoni, F A Tamarit, D R Chialvo, S A Cannas, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 108701 (2009). This mechanism is incorporated into a model of a growing network of interacting agents in which each new agent's membership in the network is determined by the agent's effect on the network's global stability. We show that, out of this stability constraint, several topological properties observed in biological networks emerge in a self organized manner. The influence of the stability selection mechanism on the dynamics associated to the resulting network is analyzed as well.},

In this contribution, we present a module-based method to efficiently fragment complex networks. The procedure firstly identifies topological communities through which the network can be represented using a well established heuristic algorithm of community finding. Then only the nodes that participate of inter-community links are removed in descending order of their betweenness centrality. We illustrate the method by applying it to a variety of examples in the social, infrastructure, and biological fields. It is shown that the module-based approach always outperforms targeted attacks to vertices based on node degree or betweenness centrality rankings, with gains in efficiency strongly related to the modularity of the network. Remarkably, in the US power grid case, by deleting 3{\%} of the nodes, the proposed method breaks the original network in fragments which are twenty times smaller in size than the fragments left by betweenness-based attack.},

This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

abstract = {The network dismantling problem asks the minimum separate node set of a graph whose removal will break the graph into connected components with the size not larger than the one percentage of the original graph. This problem has attracted much attention recently and a lot of algorithms have been proposed. However, most of the network dismantling algorithms mainly focus on which nodes are included in the minimum separate set but overlook how to order them for removal, which will lead to low general efficiency during the dismantling process. In this paper, we reformulate the network dismantling problem by taking the order of nodes' removal into consideration. An efficient dismantling sequence will break the network quickly during the dismantling processes. We take the belief-propagation guided decimation (BPD) dismantling algorithm, a state-of-the-art algorithm, as an example, and employ the node explosive percolation (NEP) algorithm to reorder the early part of the dismantling sequence given by the BPD. The proposed method is denoted as the NEP-BPD algorithm (NBA) here. The numerical results on Erd{\"{o}}s-R{\'{e}}nyi graphs, random-regular graphs, scale-free graphs, and some real networks show the high general efficiency of NBA during the entire dismantling process. In addition, numerical computations on random graph ensembles with the size from 210 to 219 exhibit that the NBA is in the same complexity class with the BPD algorithm. It is clear that the NEP method we used to improve the general efficiency could also be applied to other dismantling algorithms, such as Min-Sum algorithm, equal graph partitioning algorithm and so on.},

abstract = {Closeness is a widely-studied centrality measure. Since it requires all pairwise distances, computing closeness for all nodes is infeasible for large real-world networks. However, for many applications, it is only necessary to find the k most central nodes and not all closeness values. Prior work has shown that computing the top-k nodes with highest closeness can be done much faster than computing closeness for all nodes in real-world networks. However, for networks that evolve over time, no dynamic top-k closeness algorithm exists that improves on static recomputation. In this paper, we present several techniques that allow us to efficiently compute the k nodes with highest (harmonic) closeness after an edge insertion or an edge deletion. Our algorithms use information obtained during earlier computations to omit unnecessary work. However, they do not require asymptotically more memory than the static algorithms (i. e., linear in the number of nodes). We propose separate algorithms for complex networks (which exhibit the small-world property) and networks with large diameter such as street networks, and we compare them against static recomputation on a variety of real-world networks. On many instances, our dynamic algorithms are two orders of magnitude faster than recomputation; on some large graphs, we even reach average speedups between {\$}10{\^{}}3{\$} and {\$}10{\^{}}4{\$}.},

abstract = {Introduction: Nonattendance at scheduled outpatient appointments for primary care is a major health care problem worldwide. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of nonattendance at scheduled appointments for outpatients seeking primary care, to identify associated factors and build a model that predicts nonattendance at scheduled appointments. Methods: A cohort study of adult patients, who had a scheduled outpatient appointment for primary care, was conducted between January 2010 and July 2011, at the Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires. We evaluated the history and characteristics of these patients, and their scheduling and attendance at appointments. Patients were divided into two groups: those who attended their scheduled appointments, and those who did not. We estimated the odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI), and generated a predictive model for nonattendance, with logistic regression, using factors associated with lack of attendance, and those considered clinically relevant. Alternative models were compared using Akaike's Information Criterion. A generation cohort and a validation cohort were assigned randomly. Results: Of 113,716 appointments included in the study, 25,687 were missed (22.7{\%}; 95{\%} CI: 22.34{\%}-22.83{\%}). We found a statistically significant association between nonattendance and age (OR: 0.99; 95{\%} CI: 0.99-0.99), number of issues in the personal health record (OR: 0.98; 95{\%} CI: 0.98-0.99), time between the request for and date of appointment (OR: 1; 95{\%} CI: 1-1), history of nonattendance (OR: 1.07; 95{\%} CI: 1.07-1.07), appointment scheduled later than 4 pm (OR: 1.30; 95{\%} CI: 1.24-1.35), and specific days of the week (OR: 1.00; 95{\%} CI: 1.06-1.1). The predictive model for nonattendance included characteristics of the patient requesting the appointment, the appointment request, and the actual appointment date. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the predictive model in the generation cohort was 0.892 (95{\%} CI: 0.890-0.894). Conclusion: Evidence related to patient characteristics, and the identification of appointments with a higher likelihood of nonattendance, should promote guided strategies to reduce the rate of nonattendance, as well as to future research on this topic. The use of predictive models could further guide management strategies to reduce the rate of nonattendance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Giunta et al.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel strategy to discover the community structure of (possibly, large) networks. This approach is based on the well-know concept of network modularity optimization. To do so, our algorithm exploits a novel measure of edge centrality, based on the {\&}{\#}x03BA;-paths. This technique allows to efficiently compute a edge ranking in large networks in near linear time. Once the centrality ranking is calculated, the algorithm computes the pairwise proximity between nodes of the network. Finally, it discovers the community structure adopting a strategy inspired by the well-known state-of-the-art Louvain method (henceforth, LM), efficiently maximizing the network modularity. The experiments we carried out show that our algorithm outperforms other techniques and slightly improves results of the original LM, providing reliable results. Another advantage is that its adoption is naturally extended even to unweighted networks, differently with respect to the LM.},

abstract = {Network topology and its relationship to tie strengths may hinder or enhance the spreading of information in social networks. We study the correlations between tie strengths and topology in networks of scientific collaboration, and show that these are very different from ordinary social networks. For the latter, it has earlier been shown that strong ties are associated with dense network neighborhoods, while weaker ties act as bridges between these. Because of this, weak links act as bottlenecks for the diffusion of information. We show that on the contrary, in co-authorship networks dense local neighborhoods mainly consist of weak links, whereas strong links are more important for overall connectivity. The important role of strong links is further highlighted in simulations of information spreading, where their topological position is seen to speed up spreading dynamics. Thus, in contrast to ordinary social networks, weight-topology correlations enhance the flow of information across scientific collaboration networks. {\textcopyright} Europhysics Letters Association.},

We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics such as language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics such as age. As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

abstract = {Although widely used in practice, the behavior and accuracy of the popular module identification technique called modularity maximization is not well understood in practical contexts. Here, we present a broad characterization of its performance in such situations. First, we revisit and clarify the resolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show that the modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an exponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a clear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum modularity Qmax for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it depends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules it contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we show that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not all, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and the distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any modularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in scientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successful at finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics can disagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude by discussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combining information from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.},

Here, we develop a FSS theory for the explosive percolation transition arising in the Erdos and Renyi model under the Achlioptas process. A scaling function is derived based on the observed fact that the derivative of the curve of the order parameter at the critical point t(c) diverges with system size in a power-law manner, which is different from the conventional one based on the divergence of the correlation length at t(c). We show that the susceptibility is also described in the same scaling form. Numerical simulation data for different system sizes are well collapsed on the respective scaling functions.},

Such an approximation, however, holds only to a limited extent, as real graphs are often characterized by high frequencies of short loops. We present here a theoretical framework able to overcome such a limitation for the case of site percolation. Our method is based on a message passing algorithm that discounts redundant paths along triangles in the graph. We systematically test the approach on 98 real-world graphs and on synthetic networks. We find excellent accuracy in the prediction of the whole percolation diagram, with significant improvement with respect to the prediction obtained under the locally tree-like approximation. Residual discrepancies between theory and simulations do not depend on clustering and can be attributed to the presence of loops longer than three edges. We present also a method to account for clustering in bond percolation, but the improvement with respect to the method based on the tree-like approximation is much less apparent.},

abstract = {We provide a phenomenological theory for topological transitions in restructuring networks. In this statistical mechanical approach energy is assigned to the different network topologies and temperature is used as a quantity referring to the level of noise during the rewiring of the edges. The associated microscopic dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition and is equivalent to a lattice gas model on the edge-dual graph of a fully connected network. In our studies—based on an exact enumeration method, Monte Carlo simulations, and theoretical considerations—we find a rich variety of topological phase transitions when the temperature is varied. These transitions signal singular changes in the essential features of the global structure of the network. Depending on the energy function chosen, the observed transitions can be best monitored using the order parameters [Formula presented] i.e., the size of the largest connected component divided by the number of edges, or [Formula presented] the largest degree in the network divided by the number of edges. If, for example, the energy is chosen to be [Formula presented] the observed transition is analogous to the percolation phase transition of random graphs. For this choice of the energy, the phase diagram in the [Formula presented] plane is constructed. Single-vertex energies of the form [Formula presented] where [Formula presented] is the degree of vertex i, are also studied. Depending on the form of [Formula presented] first-order and continuous phase transitions can be observed. In case of [Formula presented] the transition is continuous, and at the critical temperature scale-free graphs can be recovered. Finally, by abruptly decreasing the temperature, nonequilibrium processes (e.g., nucleation and growth of particular topological phases) can also be interpreted by the present approach. {\textcopyright} 2004 The American Physical Society.},

Here, we present more detailed results for biased edge percolation on scale-free networks. We assume a network in which the probability for an edge between nodes i and j to be retained is proportional to (k(i)k(j)(-alpha) with k(i) and k(j) the degrees of the nodes. We discuss two methods of network reconstruction, sequential and simultaneous, and investigate their properties by analytical and numerical means. The system is examined away from the percolation transition, where the size of the giant cluster is obtained, and close to the transition, where nonuniversal critical exponents are extracted using the generating-functions method. The theory is found to agree quite well with simulations. By presenting an extension of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn construction, we find that biased percolation is well-described by the q--{\textgreater}1 limit of the q -state Potts model with inhomogeneous couplings.},

In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0,1] range better than other normalized variants.},

abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network . Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web , the Internet, social networks and cells . We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

We explore a process with the opposite selection rule, in which the biggest clusters of the randomly chosen ones merge together. We develop a theory of this kind of percolation based on the Smoluchowsky equation, find the percolation threshold, and describe the scaling properties of this continuous transition, namely, the critical exponents and amplitudes, and scaling functions. We show that, qualitatively, this transition is similar to the ordinary percolation one, though occurring in less connected systems.},

abstract = {The uneven distribution of wealth and individual economic capacities are among the main forces which shape modern societies and arguably bias the emerging social structures. However, the study of correlations between the social network and economic status of individuals is difficult due to the lack of large-scale multimodal data disclosing both the social ties and economic indicators of the same population. Here, we close this gap through the analysis of coupled datasets recording the mobile phone communications and bank transaction history of one million anonymised individuals living in a Latin American country. We show that wealth and debt are unevenly distributed among people in agreement with the Pareto principle; the observed social structure is strongly stratified, with people being better connected to others of their own socioeconomic class rather than to others of different classes; the social network appears with assortative socioeconomic correlations and tightly connected "rich clubs"; and that egos from the same class live closer to each other but commute further if they are wealthier. These results are based on a representative, society-large population, and empirically demonstrate some long-lasting hypotheses on socioeconomic correlations which potentially lay behind social segregation, and induce differences in human mobility.},

For a large class of random graphs, this problem is tightly connected to the decycling problem (the removal of vertices, leaving the graph acyclic). Exploiting this connection and recent works on epidemic spreading, we present precise predictions for the minimal size of a dismantling set in a large random graph with a prescribed (light-tailed) degree distribution. Building on the statistical mechanics perspective, we propose a three-stage Min-Sum algorithm for efficiently dismantling networks, including heavy-tailed ones for which the dismantling and decycling problems are not equivalent. We also provide additional insights into the dismantling problem, concluding that it is an intrinsically collective problem and that optimal dismantling sets cannot be viewed as a collection of individually well-performing nodes.},

The call-in process for 400 clinic days was simulated and for each day two schedules were created: the traditional method that assigned one patient per appointment slot, and the proposed method that scheduled patients according to their no-show probability to balance patient waiting, overtime and revenue.

@article{Gao2016,
abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

abstract = {Scientific production is steadily growing, exhibiting 4{\%} annual growth in publications and 1.8{\%} annual growth in the number of references per publication, together producing a 12-year doubling period in the total supply of references, i.e. links in the science citation network. This growth has far-reaching implications for how academic knowledge is connected, accessed and evaluated. Against this background, we analyzed a citation network comprised of 837 million references produced by 32.6 million publications over the period 1965-2012, allowing for a detailed analysis of the 'attention economy' in science. Our results show how growth relates to 'citation inflation', increased connectivity in the citation network resulting from decreased levels of uncitedness, and a narrowing range of attention - as both very classic and very recent literature are being cited increasingly less. The decreasing attention to recent literature published within the last 6 years suggests that science has become stifled by a publication deluge destabilizing the balance between production and consumption. To better understand these patterns together, we developed a generative model of the citation network, featuring exponential growth, the redirection of scientific attention via publications' reference lists, and the crowding out of old literature by the new. We validate our model against several empirical benchmarks, and then use perturbation analysis to measure the impact of shifts in citing behavior on the synthetic system's properties, thereby providing insights into the functionality of the science citation network as an infrastructure supporting the memory of science.},

Disturbances can prompt desynchronization, which is a process that has been involved in large power outages. Here we derive a condition under which the desired synchronous state of a power grid is stable, and use this condition to identify tunable parameters of the generators that are determinants of spontaneous synchronization. Our analysis gives rise to an approach to specify parameter assignments that can enhance synchronization of any given network, which we demonstrate for a selection of both test systems and real power grids. These findings may be used to optimize stability and help devise new control schemes, thus offering an additional layer of protection and contributing to the development of smart grids that can recover from failures in real time.},

abstract = {The betweenness centrality, a path-based global measure of flow, is a static predictor of congestion and load on networks. Here we demonstrate that its statistical distribution is invariant for planar networks, that are used to model many infrastructural and biological systems. Empirical analysis of street networks from 97 cities worldwide, along with simulations of random planar graph models, indicates the observed invariance to be a consequence of a bimodal regime consisting of an underlying tree structure for high betweenness nodes, and a low betweenness regime corresponding to loops providing local path alternatives. Furthermore, the high betweenness nodes display a non-trivial spatial clustering with increasing spatial correlation as a function of the edge-density. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of betweenness is a more accurate discriminator than its statistics for comparing  static congestion patterns and  its evolution across cities as demonstrated by analyzing 200 years of street data for Paris.},

First, they have non-trivial clustering or network transitivity, and second, they show positive correlations, also called assortative mixing, between the degrees of adjacent vertices. Social networks are often divided into groups or communities, and it has recently been suggested that this division could account for the observed clustering. We demonstrate that group structure in networks can also account for degree correlations. We show using a simple model that we should expect assortative mixing in such networks whenever there is variation in the sizes of the groups and that the predicted level of assortative mixing compares well with that observed in real-world networks.},

It combines the explosive percolation (EP) paradigm with the idea of maintaining a fragmented distribution of clusters. The ability of each node to block the spread of an infection (or to prevent the existence of a large cluster of connected nodes) is estimated by a score. The algorithm proceeds by first identifying low score nodes that should not be vaccinated/destroyed, analogously to the links selected in EP if they do not lead to large clusters. As in EP, this is done by selecting the worst node (weakest blocker) from a finite set of randomly chosen `candidates'. Tests on several real-world and model networks suggest that the method is more efficient and faster than any existing immunization strategy. Due to the latter property it can deal with very large networks.},

We begin by review- ing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Milligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from cOrrespond- ing partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addi- tion to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between -4-I},

This unregulated growth leads to a huge and complex web, which becomes a large directed graph whose vertices are documents and whose edges are links (URLs) that point from one document to another. The topology of this graph determines the web's connectivity and consequently how effectively we can locate information on it.

While the percolation transition is known as one of the most robust continuous transitions, the percolation transitions occurring in complex systems are often of different types such as discontinuous, hybrid, and infinite-order phase transitions. Thus, percolation has received considerable attention in network science community. Here we present a very brief review of percolation theory recently developed, which includes those types of phase transitions, critical phenomena, and finite-size scaling theory. Moreover, we discuss potential applications of theoretical results and several open questions including universal behaviors.},

Using our algorithm we are able to demonstrate, convincingly and with high accuracy, the fractal character of watershed lines. We find the fractal dimension of watersheds to be Df = 1.211±0.001 for artificial landscapes, Df = 1.10±0.01 for the Alps and Df = 1.11±0.01 for the Himalayas. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Simon argued analytically that a population of flavored elements growing by either adding a novel element or randomly replicating an existing one would afford a distribution of group sizes with a power-law tail. Here, we show that, in fact, Simon's model does not produce a simple power law size distribution as the initial element has a dominant first-mover advantage, and will be overrepresented by a factor proportional to the inverse of the innovation probability. The first group's size discrepancy cannot be explained away as a transient of the model, and may therefore be many orders of magnitude greater than expected. We demonstrate how Simon's analysis was correct but incomplete, and expand our alternate analysis to quantify the variability of long term rankings for all groups. We find that the expected time for a first replication is infinite, and show how an incipient group must break the mechanism to improve their odds of success. Our findings call for a reexamination of preceding work invoking Simon's model and provide a revised understanding going forward.},

abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

We do not attempt to determine the order of the explosive transition. Finally, we study and compare the direct and reverse processes, showing that while the reverse process is different from the direct process for finite size systems, the two cases become equivalent in the thermodynamic limit of large {\$}L{\$}.},

Measuring the changes on the onset of congestion, we observe different behaviors depending on the network structure, governed by the distribution of the algorithmic betweenness (number of paths traversing a node given a communication protocol) of the nodes, and particularly by the node with the highest betweenness. We also compare the robustness of networks from a topological and dynamical point of view. We find that for certain values of traffic load, after suffering a random failure, the network can be physically connected but the nodes are unable to communicate due congestion. These results highlight the necessity to include dynamical considerations in studies about resilience of complex networks.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships that unite all lineages (the tree of life) is a grand challenge. The paucity of homologous character data across disparately related lineages currently renders direct phylogenetic inference untenable. To reconstruct a comprehensive tree of life, we therefore synthesized published phylogenies, together with taxonomic classifications for taxa never incorporated into a phylogeny. We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips-the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. Although data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics.},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behav- ior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law dis- tributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

abstract = {Recently, the study of optimizing network robustness has attracted increasing attentions, and the constraint that every node's degree cannot be changed is considered. Although this constraint maintains the node degree distribution consistently in order to reserve the structure of networks, it makes the network structure be lack of flexibility since many network structure always transform in the modern society. Given this consideration, in this paper, we analyze the robustness of networks through setting a new constraint; that is, only the number of edges should be unchanged. Then, we use the link-robustness index (Rl) as the measure of the network robustness against either random failures or intentional attacks, and make a comparative analysis of network robustness against different types of link attacks. Moreover, we use four types of networks as initial networks, namely scale-free networks, random networks, regular networks, and small-world networks. The experimental results show that the values of robustness measures for the optimized networks starting from different initial networks are similar under different link attacks, but the network topologies may be different. That is to say, networks with different topologies may have similar robustness in terms of the robustness measures. We also find that the optimized networks obtained by one link attack may not robust against other link attacks, sometimes, even weaker than the original networks. Therefore, before building networks, it is better to study which type of link attacks may happen.},

In percolation and regular aggregation, clusters of any size merge until a giant component dominates the entire system. Here we establish 'fractional percolation', in which the coalescence of clusters that substantially differ in size is systematically suppressed. We identify and study percolation models that exhibit multiple jumps in the order parameter where the position and magnitude of the jumps are randomly distributed-characteristic of crackling noise. This enables us to express crackling noise as a result of the simple concept of fractional percolation. In particular, the framework allows us to link percolation with phenomena exhibiting non-self-averaging and power law fluctuations such as Barkhausen noise in ferromagnets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In fact many applications can also be found for this novel fracture problem.

For weak disorder, the number of cracks spreads all over the entire network before global connectivity is lost.

Many algorithms have been proposed so far, but none of them has been subjected to strict tests to evaluate their performance. Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)] and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 7327 (2007); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 1118 (2008)], Blondel [J.

In an attempt to better understand this concept, we study the relationship between the strength of the community structure and the network transitivity (or clustering coefficient). Although intuitively appealing, this analysis was not performed before. We adopt an approach based on random models to empirically study how one property varies depending on the other. It turns out the transitivity increases with the community structure strength, and is also affected by the distribution of the community sizes. Furthermore, increasing the transitivity also results in a stronger community structure. More surprisingly, if a very weak community structure causes almost zero transitivity, the opposite is not true and a network with a close to zero transitivity can still have a clearly defined community structure. Further analytical work is necessary to characterize the exact nature of the identified relationship},

abstract = {The concept of network efficiency, recently proposed to characterize the properties of small-world networks, is here used to study the effects of errors and attacks on scale-free networks. Two different kinds of scale-free networks, i.e., networks with power law P(k), are considered: (1) scale-free networks with no local clustering produced by the Barabasi-Albert model and (2) scale-free networks with high clustering properties as in the model by Klemm and Egu{\'{i}}luz, and their properties are compared to the properties of random graphs (exponential graphs). By using as mathematical measures the global and the local efficiency we investigate the effects of errors and attacks both on the global and the local properties of the network. We show that the global efficiency is a better measure than the characteristic path length to describe the response of complex networks to external factors. We find that, at variance with random graphs, scale-free networks display, both on a global and on a local scale, a high degree of error tolerance and an extreme vulnerability to attacks. In fact, the global and the local efficiency are unaffected by the failure of some randomly chosen nodes, though they are extremely sensitive to the removal of the few nodes which play a crucial role in maintaining the network's connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Complex systems are very often organized under the form of networks where nodes and edges are embedded in space. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The frequency and size of these bursts affect the magnitude of temporal fluctuations in messenger RNA and protein content within a cell, creating variation or “noise” in gene expression. It is still unclear to what degree transcriptional kinetics are specific to each gene and determined by its promoter sequence. Alternative scenarios have been proposed, in which the kinetics of transcription are governed by cellular constraints and follow universal rules across the genome. Evidence from genome-wide noise studies and from systematic perturbations of promoter sequences suggest that both scenarios—namely gene-specific versus genome-wide regulation of transcription kinetics—may be present to different degrees in bacteria, yeast, and animal cells.},

abstract = {Modularity is a popular measure of community structure. However, maximizing the modularity can lead to many competing partitions, with almost the same modularity, that are poorly correlated with each other. It can also produce illusory "communities" in random graphs where none exist. We address this problem by using the modularity as a Hamiltonian at finite temperature, and using an efficient Belief Propagation algorithm to obtain the consensus of many partitions with high modularity, rather than looking for a single partition that maximizes it. We show analytically and numerically that the proposed algorithm works all the way down to the detectability transition in networks generated by the stochastic block model. It also performs well on real-world networks, revealing large communities in some networks where previous work has claimed no communities exist. Finally we show that by applying our algorithm recursively, subdividing communities until no statistically-significant subcommunities can be found, we can detect hierarchical structure in real-world networks more efficiently than previous methods.},

abstract = {Mutual information is a very popular measure for comparing clusterings. Previous work has shown that it is beneficial to make an adjustment for chance to this measure, by subtracting an expected value and normalizing via an upper bound. This yields the constant baseline property that enhances intuitiveness. In this paper, we argue that a further type of statistical adjustment for the mutual information is also beneficial --- an adjustment to correct selection bias. This type of adjustment is useful when carrying out many clustering comparisons, to select one or more preferred clusterings. It reduces the tendency for the mutual information to choose clustering solutions i) with more clusters, or ii) induced on fewer data points, when compared to a reference one. We term our new adjusted measure the standardized mutual information. It requires computation of the variance of mutual information under a hypergeometric model of randomness, which is technically challenging. We derive an analytical formula for this variance and analyze its complexity. We then experimentally assess how our new measure can address selection bias and also increase interpretability. We recommend using the standardized mutual information when making multiple clustering comparisons in situations where the number of records is small compared to the number of clusters considered.},

In hierarchical networks the degree of clustering characterizing the different groups follows a strict scaling law, which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical organization in real networks. We find that several real networks, such as the World Wide Web, actor network, the Internet at the domain level and the semantic web obey this scaling law, indicating that hierarchy is a fundamental characteristic of many complex systems.},

abstract = {We review results on the scaling of the optimal path length l(opt) in random networks with weighted links or nodes. We refer to such networks as "weighted" or "disordered" networks. The optimal path is the path with minimum sum of the weights. In strong disorder, where the maximal weight along the path dominates the sum, we find that l(opt) increases dramatically compared to the known small-world result for the minimum distance l(min) similar to log N, where N is the number of nodes. For Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks l(opt) similar to N-1/3, while for scale free (SF) networks, with degree distribution P(k) similar to k(-lambda), we find that l(opt) scales as N-(lambda 3)/(lambda/1) for 3 {\textless} lambda {\textless} 4 and as N-1/3 for 3 {\textgreater}= 4. Thus, for these networks, the small-world nature is destroyed. For 2 {\textless} lambda {\textless} 3 in contrary, our numerical results suggest that l(opt) scales as ln(lambda-1) 1 N, representing still a small world. We also find numerically that for weak disorder l(opt) similar to ln N for ER models as well as for SF networks. We also review the transition between the strong and weak disorder regimes in the scaling properties of l(opt) for ER and SF networks and for a general distribution of weights tau, P(tau). For a weight distribution of the form P(tau) = 1/(a tau) with (tau(min) {\textless} tau {\textless} tau(max)) and a = ln tau(max)/ tmin, we find that there is a crossover network size N* = N*( a) at which the transition occurs. For N {\textless}{\textless} N* the scaling behavior of l(opt) is in the strong disorder regime, while for N {\textless}{\textless} N* the scaling behavior is in the weak disorder regime. The value of N* can be determined from the expression l(infinity)(N*) = ap(c), where l(infinity) is the optimal path length in the limit of strong disorder, A = ap(c) -{\textgreater} infinity and pc is the percolation threshold of the network. We suggest that for any P(tau) the distribution of optimal path lengths has a universal form which is controlled by the scaling parameter Z = l(infinity)/A where A = p(c)tau(c)/integral(tau c)(0) tau P(tau) d tau plays the role of the disorder strength and tau(c) is defined by integral(tau c)(0) P(tau)d tau = p(c). In case P(tau) similar to 1/(at), the equation for A is reduced to A = ap(c). The relation for A is derived analytically and supported by numerical simulations for Erdos-Renyi and scale-free graphs. We also determine which form of P(tau) can lead to strong disorder A -{\textgreater} infinity. We then study the minimum spanning tree (MST), which is the subset of links of the network connecting all nodes of the network such that it minimizes the sum of their weights. We show that the minimum spanning tree (MST) in the strong disorder limit is composed of percolation clusters, which we regard as "super-nodes", interconnected by a scale-free tree. The MST is also considered to be the skeleton of the network where the main transport occurs. We furthermore show that the MST can be partitioned into two distinct components, having significantly different transport properties, characterized by centrality - number of times a node (or link) is used by transport paths.One component the superhighways, for which the nodes (or links) with high centrality dominate, corresponds to the largest cluster at the percolation threshold (incipient infinite ercolation cluster) which is a subset of the MST. The other component, roads, includes the remaining nodes, low centrality nodes dominate. We find also that the distribution of the centrality for the incipient infinite percolation cluster satisfies a power law, with an exponent smaller than that for the entire MST. We demonstrate the significance identifying the superhighways by showing that one can improve significantly the global transport by improving a very small fraction of the network, the superhighways.},

Its relationship with access to health care has been recognized and is of particular relevance in light of the access targets set out in the NHS Plan. Methods. The literature was searched for articles relating to non-attendance. Titles and abstracts were examined, and relevant articles obtained. Bibliographies were examined for further references. Articles that described interventions for reducing non-attendance that were comparative studies and that examined general appointments, as opposed to appointments for screening purposes for example, were of particular interest. Results and conclusions. The epidemiology of non-attendance has been well described, but there is little work on the reasons for non-attendance. Evidence for effective interventions to improve attendance in primary care is lacking, and this may prove to be an area of research interest in the future. As well as specific interventions to reduce non-attendance, new approaches to health care access are required in order to tackle this issue.},

abstract = {Recent work on the structure of social networks and the internet has focused attention on graphs with distributions of vertex degree that are significantly different from the Poisson degree distributions that have been widely studied in the past. In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.},

Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon craters, wars and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws.

These types of graphs are often robust, i.e., they are able to function well even if they are subject to limited removal of elementary building blocks, as may occur for random failures or targeted attacks. Here, we study how the structure of these graphs is affected when nodes get removed successively until an extensive fraction is removed such that the graphs fragment. We study different types of proximity graphs for various node-removal strategies. We use different types of observables to monitor the fragmentation process, simple ones like the number and sizes of connected components and more complex ones like the hop diameter and the backup capacity, which is needed to make a network N−1 resilient. The actual fragmentation turns out to be described by a second-order phase transition. Using finite-size scaling analyses we numerically assess the threshold fraction of removed nodes, which is characteristic for the particular graph type and node deletion scheme; this suffices to decompose the underlying graphs.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Finding an optimal subset of nodes in a network that is able to efficiently disrupt the functioning of a corrupt or criminal organization or contain an epidemic or the spread of misinformation is a highly relevant problem of network science. In this paper, we address the generalized network-dismantling problem, which aims at finding a set of nodes whose removal from the network results in the fragmentation of the network into subcritical network components at minimal overall cost. Compared with previous formulations, we allow the costs of node removals to take arbitrary nonnegative real values, which may depend on topological properties such as node centrality or on nontopological features such as the price or protection level of a node. Interestingly, we show that nonunit costs imply a significantly different dismantling strategy. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a method which is based on the spectral properties of a node-weighted Laplacian operator and combine it with a fine-tuning mechanism related to the weighted vertex cover problem. The proposed method is applicable to large-scale networks with millions of nodes. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and opens more directions for understanding the vulnerability and robustness of complex systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We use a core molecular model capable of generating circadian rhythms to assess the robustness of circadian oscillations with respect to molecular noise. The model is based on the negative feedback exerted by a regulatory protein on the expression of its gene. Such a negative regulatory mechanism underlies circadian oscillations of the PER protein in Drosophila and of the FRQ protein in Neurospora. The model incorporates gene transcription into mRNA, translation of mRNA into protein, reversible phosphorylation leading to degradation of the regulatory protein, transport of the latter into the nucleus, and repression of gene expression by the nuclear form of the protein. To assess the effect of molecular noise, we perform stochastic simulations after decomposing the deterministic model into elementary reaction steps. The oscillations predicted by the stochastic simulations agree with those obtained with the deterministic version of the model. We show that robust circadian oscillations can occur already with a limited number of mRNA and protein molecules, in the range of tens and hundreds, respectively. Entrainment by light/dark cycles and cooperativity in repression enhance the robustness of circadian oscillations with respect to molecular noise.},

However, its performance heavily relies on the quality of training data. Due to many complex real-applications, noises coming from various possible sources are often prevalent in large scale databases. How to eliminate anomalies and improve the quality of data is still a challenge. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose a new anomaly removal and learning algorithm under the framework of kNN. The primary characteristic of our method is that the evidence of removing anomalies and predicting class labels of unseen instances is mutual nearest neighbors, rather than k nearest neighbors. The advantage is that pseudo nearest neighbors can be identified and will not be taken into account during the prediction process. Consequently, the final learning result is more creditable. An extensive comparative experimental analysis carried out on UCI datasets provided empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method for enhancing the performance of the k-NN rule. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power law with an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent. We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with composite decisions.},

abstract = {A number of important transport networks, such as the airline and trade networks of the world, exhibit a characteristic core-periphery structure, wherein a few nodes are highly interconnected and the rest of the network frays into a tree. Mechanisms underlying the emergence of core-peripheries, however, remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a simple pruning process based on removal of underutilized links and redistribution of loads can lead to the emergence of core-peripheries. Links are assumed beneficial if they either carry a sufficiently large load or are essential for global connectivity. This incentivized redistribution process is controlled by a single parameter which balances connectivity and profit. The obtained networks exhibit a highly resilient and connected core with a frayed periphery. The balanced network shows a higher resilience than the World Airline Network or the World Trade Network, revealing a pathway towards robust structural features through pruning.},

abstract = {Finding central nodes is a fundamental problem in network analysis. Betweenness centrality is a well-known measure which quantifies the importance of a node based on the fraction of shortest paths going though it. Due to the dynamic nature of many today's networks, algorithms that quickly update centrality scores have become a necessity. For betweenness, several dynamic algorithms have been proposed over the years, targeting different update types (incremental- and decremental-only, fully-dynamic). In this paper we introduce a new dynamic algorithm for updating betweenness centrality after an edge insertion or an edge weight decrease. Our method is a combination of two independent contributions: a faster algorithm for updating pairwise distances as well as number of shortest paths, and a faster algorithm for updating dependencies. Whereas the worst-case running time of our algorithm is the same as recomputation, our techniques considerably reduce the number of operations performed by existing dynamic betweenness algorithms.},

Present econophysics models are usually employed on presumed random networks of interacting agents, and only some macroscopic properties (e.g. the resulting wealth distribution) are compared to real-world data. In this paper, we analyze Bitcoin, which is a novel digital currency system, where the complete list of transactions is publicly available. Using this dataset, we reconstruct the network of transactions and extract the time and amount of each payment. We analyze the structure of the transaction network by measuring network characteristics over time, such as the degree distribution, degree correlations and clustering. We find that linear preferential attachment drives the growth of the network. We also study the dynamics taking place on the transaction network, i.e. the flow of money. We measure temporal patterns and the wealth accumulation. Investigating the microscopic statistics of money movement, we find that sublinear preferential attachment governs the evolution of the wealth distribution. We report a scaling law between the degree and wealth associated to individual nodes.},

Modern systems, such as critical infrastructure networks and cyber-physical systems, however, become increasingly dependent on others, which can be encapsulated into the framework of interdependent networks. In this brief, we focus on the optimal dismantling of interdependent networks, and propose a novel algorithm, named inverse explosive percolation (IEP), to find the optimal removal nodes. The IEP proceeds by first identifying the nodes which make the least contribution to the giant mutual connected cluster of interdependent networks. When nodes have the same contribution, the one with the smallest overlapping degree is selected. We apply the IEP algorithm to interdependent networks composed of real-world power grids, Internet networks and artificial networks, and find IEP performs much better than the existing methods in various kinds of networks. Based on its efficiency, IEP can be applied to large-scale systems.},

The hyperbolic circle aims to become a universal space of representation and analysis of many real networks. Yet, inferring the angular coordinates to map a real network back to its latent geometry remains a challenging inverse problem. Here, we show that intelligent machines for unsupervised recognition and visualization of similarities in big data can also infer the network angular coordinates of the hyperbolic model according to a geometrical organization that we term “angular coalescence.” Based on this phenomenon, we propose a class of algorithms that offers fast and accurate “coalescent embedding” in the hyperbolic circle even for large networks. This computational solution to an inverse problem in physics of complex systems favors the application of network latent geometry techniques in disciplines dealing with big network data analysis including biology, medicine, and social science.},

@article{Traag2015,
abstract = {Many complex networks exhibit a modular structure of densely connected groups of nodes. Usually, such a modular structure is uncovered by the optimization of some quality function. Although flawed, modularity remains one of the most popular quality functions. The Louvain algorithm was originally developed for optimizing modularity, but has been applied to a variety of methods. As such, speeding up the Louvain algorithm, enables the analysis of larger graphs in a shorter time for various methods. We here suggest to consider moving nodes to a random neighbor community, instead of the best neighbor community. Although incredibly simple, it reduces the theoretical runtime complexity from {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(m){\$} to {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(n \backslashlog \backslashlangle k \backslashrangle){\$} in networks with a clear community structure. In benchmark networks, it speeds up the algorithm roughly 2-3 times, while in some real networks it even reaches 10 times faster runtimes. This improvement is due to two factors: (1) a random neighbor is likely to be in a "good" community; and (2) random neighbors are likely to be hubs, helping the convergence. Finally, the performance gain only slightly diminishes the quality, especially for modularity, thus providing a good quality-performance ratio. However, these gains are less pronounced, or even disappear, for some other measures such as significance or surprise.},

The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For "ordinary" chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called "the reaction probability density function." The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications. ?? 1976.},

The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.},

Variations on the model are able to produce undirected scale-free networks with exponent {\$}\backslashgamma=2{\$} or directed networks with power-law out-degree distribution with tunable exponent {\$}\backslashgamma \backslashin (1,2){\$}. We also extend the model to that of directed {\$}2{\$}-dimensional simplicial complexes. Simplicial complexes are generalization of networks that can encode the many body interactions between the parts of a complex system and as such are becoming increasingly popular to characterize different data sets ranging from social interacting systems to the brain.

abstract = {Complex networks from such different fields as biology, technology or sociology share similar organization principles. The possibility of a unique growth mechanism promises to uncover universal origins of collective behaviour. In particular, the emergence of self-similarity in complex networks raises the fundamental question of the growth process according to which these structures evolve. Here we investigate the concept of renormalization as a mechanism for the growth of fractal and non-fractal modular networks. We show that the key principle that gives rise to the fractal architecture of networks is a strong effective 'repulsion' (or, disassortativity) between the most connected nodes (that is, the hubs) on all length scales, rendering them very dispersed. More importantly, we show that a robust network comprising functional modules, such as a cellular network, necessitates a fractal topology, suggestive of an evolutionary drive for their existence.},

abstract = {Despite degree distributions give some insights about how heterogeneous a network is, they fail in giving a unique quantitative characterization of network heterogeneity. This is particularly the case when several different distributions fit for the same network, when the number of data points is very scarce due to network size, or when we have to compare two networks with completely different degree distributions. Here we propose a unique characterization of network heterogeneity based on the difference of functions of node degrees for all pairs of linked nodes. We show that this heterogeneity index can be expressed as a quadratic form of the Laplacian matrix of the network, which allows a spectral representation of network heterogeneity. We give bounds for this index, which is equal to zero for any regular network and equal to one only for star graphs. Using it we study random networks showing that those generated by the Erd{\"{o}}s-R{\'{e}}nyi algorithm have zero heterogeneity, and those generated by the preferential attachment method of Barab{\'{a}}si and Albert display only 11{\%} of the heterogeneity of a star graph. We finally study 52 real-world networks and we found that they display a large variety of heterogeneities. We also show that a classification system based on degree distributions does not reflect the heterogeneity properties of real-world networks.},

Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e., the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks. Here we introduce a class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes. We use this benchmark to test two popular methods of community detection, modularity optimization, and Potts model clustering. The results show that the benchmark poses a much more severe test to algorithms than standard benchmarks, revealing limits that may not be apparent at a first analysis.},

These results disagree with the theoretical data obtained on the basis of the standard drop model of finite cluster structure, in particular, they give a different value of exponent zeta (lnns approximately -szeta). Therefore, a more precise fractal model for describing the structure of clusters in a percolation system is proposed. The consideration is based on the solution of a kinetic equation for the number of finite clusters. In the framework of the proposed approach (fractal model together with kinetic equation), a correct value of exponent zeta is obtained and an explanation is given to the dependence of this exponent on the fraction of occupied sites p, which was revealed by numerical simulations. Additionally, a relation is established between the characteristics of cluster size distribution and fractal dimension of the Cantor dust constructed on the percolation cluster.},

abstract = {Many natural and social systems develop complex networks, that are usually modelled as random graphs. The eigenvalue spectrum of these graphs provides information about their structural properties. While the semi-circle law is known to describe the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs, much less is known about the eigenvalues of real-world graphs, describing such complex systems as the Internet, metabolic pathways, networks of power stations, scientific collaborations or movie actors, which are inherently correlated and usually very sparse. An important limitation in addressing the spectra of these systems is that the numerical determination of the spectra for systems with more than a few thousand nodes is prohibitively time and memory consuming. Making use of recent advances in algorithms for spectral characterization, here we develop new methods to determine the eigenvalues of networks comparable in size to real systems, obtaining several surprising results on the spectra of adjacency matrices corresponding to models of real-world graphs. We find that when the number of links grows as the number of nodes, the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs does not converge to the semi-circle law. Furthermore, the spectral densities of real-world graphs have specific features depending on the details of the corresponding models. In particular, scale-free graphs develop a triangle-like spectral density with a power law tail, while small-world graphs have a complex spectral density function consisting of several sharp peaks. These and further results indicate that the spectra of correlated graphs represent a practical tool for graph classification and can provide useful insight into the relevant structural properties of real networks.},

This is just one example among several human-oriented services which are strongly affected by human activity patterns. Recent empirical evidence is indicating that human activity patterns are characterized by power-law distributions of inter-event times, where large fluctuations rather than regularity is the common case. I show that this temporal heterogeneity can be explained by two mechanisms: (i) humans have some perception of their past activity rate and (ii) based on that they react by accelerating or reducing their activity rate. Using these two mechanisms I explain the inter-event time statistics of Darwin's and Einstein's correspondence and the email activity within an university environment. Moreover, they are typical examples of the accelerating and reducing class, respectively. These results are relevant to the system design of human-oriented services. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The robustness of complex networks under targeted attacks is deeply connected to the resilience of complex systems, which is defined as the ability to make appropriate response to the attack. In this paper, we study robustness of complex networks under a realistic assumption that the cost of removing a node is not constant but rather proportional to the degree of a node or equivalently to the number of removed links a removal action produces. We have investigated the state-of-the-art targeted node removing algorithms and demonstrate that they become very inefficient when the cost of the attack is taken into consideration. For the case when it is possible to attack or remove links, we propose a simple and efficient edge removal strategy named Hierarchical Power Iterative Normalized cut (HPI-Ncut). The results on real and artificial networks show that the HPI-Ncut algorithm outperforms all the node removal and link removal attack algorithms when the same definition of cost is taken into consideration. In addition, we show that, on sparse networks, the complexity of this hierarchical power iteration edge removal algorithm is only O n log 2 + $\epsilon$ ⁡ n .},

It seems that these organisms generate circadian periodicity by similar biochemical networks within a single cell2. A model based on the common features of these biochemical networks shows that a circadian network can oscillate reliably in the presence of stochastic biochemical noise and when cellular conditions are altered. We propose that the ability to resist such perturbations imposes strict constraints on the oscillation mechanisms underlying circadian periodicity in vivo.},

abstract = {An exact formula for computing the average hopcount of the shortest path in finite-size tree-like components of undirected unweighted random networks is proposed. In a tree-like component with size s, there exists virtually only one shortest path between two arbitrary nodes. The summation of hopcounts of all shortest paths can be calculated approximately by the summation of the betweenness of all nodes, and the difference between them is only a constant s(s−1). Therefore, the average hopcount can be calculated by further dividing the summation by the number of all shortest paths. In this paper, we first derive the conditional probability p(k|s) of the degree distribution of finite components with size s and the summation of all nodal betweenness respectively. By means of these results, we obtain the exact formula for calculating the average hopcount. Also, We confirm the proposed formula by simulations for networks with Poisson and power law degree distributions respectively.},

We also present two practical applications of the scheme, detection of transition between two dynamical regimes in a time delayed system and identification of the dimensionality of the underlying system from real world data with limited number of points, through recurrence network measures.

abstract = {Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters.},

abstract = {Drosophila colour vision is achieved by R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells present in every ommatidium. The fly retina contains two types of ommatidia, called 'pale' and 'yellow', defined by different rhodopsin pairs expressed in R7 and R8 cells. Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless.},

[Science 323, 1453 (2009)] has shown that the percolation transition, which is usually continuous, becomes discontinuous ("explosive") if links are added to the system according to special cooperative rules (Achlioptas processes). In this paper we present a detailed numerical analysis of Achlioptas processes with product rule on various systems, including lattices, random networks a' la Erdoes-Renyi and scale-free networks. In all cases we recover the explosive transition by Achlioptas et al.. However, the explosive percolation transition is kind of hybrid as, despite the discontinuity of the order parameter at the threshold, one observes traces of analytical behavior, like power law distributions of cluster sizes. In particular, for scale-free networks with degree exponent lambda{\textless}3, all relevant percolation variables display power law scaling, just as in continuous second-order phase transitions.},

Such het- erogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise)and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise)contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

abstract = {A wide range of organisms use circadian clocks to keep internal sense of daily time and regulate their behavior accordingly. Most of these clocks use intracellular genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory elements. The integration of these "circuits" at the cellular level imposes strong constraints on their functioning and design. Here, we study a recently proposed model [Barkai, N. {\&} Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London), 403, 267-268] that incorporates just the essential elements found experimentally. We show that this type of oscillator is driven mainly by two elements: the concentration of a repressor protein and the dynamics of an activator protein forming an inactive complex with the repressor. Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA molecules goes below one. Under some conditions, this oscillator is not only resistant to but, paradoxically, also enhanced by the intrinsic biochemical noise.},

abstract = {Clustering is one of the most universal approaches for understanding complex data. A pivotal aspect of clustering analysis is quantitatively comparing clusterings; clustering comparison is the basis for many tasks such as clustering evaluation, consensus clustering, and tracking the temporal evolution of clusters. In particular, the extrinsic evaluation of clustering methods requires comparing the uncovered clusterings to planted clusterings or known metadata. Yet, as we demonstrate, existing clustering comparison measures have critical biases which undermine their usefulness, and no measure accommodates both overlapping and hierarchical clusterings. Here we unify the comparison of disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchically structured clusterings by proposing a new element-centric framework: elements are compared based on the relationships induced by the cluster structure, as opposed to the traditional cluster-centric philosophy. We demonstrate that, in contrast to standard clustering similarity measures, our framework does not suffer from critical biases and naturally provides unique insights into how the clusterings differ. We illustrate the strengths of our framework by revealing new insights into the organization of clusters in two applications: the improved classification of schizophrenia based on the overlapping and hierarchical community structure of fMRI brain networks, and the disentanglement of various social homophily factors in Facebook social networks. The universality of clustering suggests far-reaching impact of our framework throughout all areas of science.},

Recently, network self-similarity as a natural outcome of the evolution of real-world systems has also attracted much attention within the physics literature. Here we investigate the scaling of density in complex networks under two classical box-covering renormalizationsnetwork coarse-grainingand also different community-based renormalizations. The analysis on over 50 real-world networks reveals a power-law scaling of network density and size under adequate renormalization technique, yet irrespective of network type and origin. The results thus advance a recent discovery of a universal scaling of density among different real-world networks [P.J. Laurienti, K.E. Joyce, Q.K. Telesford, J.H. Burdette, S. Hayasaka, Universal fractal scaling of self-organized networks, Physica A 390 (20) (2011) 36083613] and imply an existence of a scale-free density also withinamong different self-similar scales ofcomplex real-world networks. The latter further improves the comprehension of self-similar structure in large real-world networks with several possible applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {C-dismantling (CD) problem aims at finding the minimum vertex set D of a graph G(V,E) after removing which the remaining graph will break into connected components with the size not larger than C. In this paper, we introduce a spin-glass model with C+1 integer-value states into the CD problem and then study the properties of this spin-glass model by the belief-propagation (BP) equations under the replica-symmetry ansatz. We give the lower bound {\$}\backslashrho{\_}c{\$} of the relative size of D with finite C on regular random graphs and Erdos-Renyi random graphs. We find {\$}\backslashrho{\_}c{\$} will decrease gradually with growing C and it converges to {\$}\backslashrho{\_}\backslashinfty{\$} as C{\$}\backslashto\backslashinfty{\$}. The CD problem is called dismantling problem when C is a small finite fraction of |V|. Therefore, {\$}\backslashrho{\_}\backslashinfty{\$} is also the lower bound of the dismantling problem when |V|{\$}\backslashto\backslashinfty{\$}. To reduce the computation complexity of the BP equations, taking the knowledge of the probability of a random selected vertex belonging to a remaining connected component with the size A, the original BP equations can be simplified to one with only three states when C{\$}\backslashto\backslashinfty{\$}. The simplified BP equations are very similar to the BP equations of the feedback vertex set spin-glass model [H.-J.{\~{}}Zhou, Eur. Phys. J. B 86, 455 (2013)]. At last, we develop two practical belief-propagation-guide decimation algorithms based on the original BP equations (CD-BPD) and the simplified BP equations (SCD-BPD) to solve the CD problem on a certain graph. Our BPD algorithms and two other state-of-art heuristic algorithms are applied on various random graphs and some real world networks. Computation results show that the CD-BPD is the best in all tested algorithms in the case of small C. But considering the performance and computation consumption, we recommend using SCD-BPD for the network with small clustering coefficient when C is large.},

abstract = {In this paper, we derive a topological pattern of urban street networks using a large sample (the largest so far to the best of our knowledge) of 40 US cities and a few more from elsewhere of different sizes. It is found that all the topologies of urban street networks based on street-street intersection demonstrate a small world structure, and a scale-free property for both street length and connectivity degree. More specifically, for any street network, about 80{\%} of its streets have length or degrees less than its average value, while 20{\%} of streets have length or degrees greater than the average. Out of the 20{\%}, there are less than 1{\%} of streets which can form a backbone of the street network. Based on the finding, we conjecture that the 20{\%} streets account for 80{\%} of traffic flow, and the 1{\%} streets constitute a cognitive map of the urban street network. We illustrate further a peculiarity about the scale-free property. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Decycling and dismantling of complex networks are underlying many important applications in network science. Recently these two closely related problems were tackled by several heuristic algorithms, simple and considerably sub-optimal, on the one hand, and involved and accurate message-passing ones that evaluate single-node marginal probabilities, on the other hand. In this paper we propose a simple and extremely fast algorithm, CoreHD, which recursively removes nodes of the highest degree from the 2-core of the network. CoreHD performs much better than all existing simple algorithms. When applied on real-world networks, it achieves equally good solutions as those obtained by the state-of-art iterative message-passing algorithms at greatly reduced computational cost, suggesting that CoreHD should be the algorithm of choice for many practical purposes.},

abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Phys. {\{}$\backslash$bf14{\}}, 583 (2018)] provides a good idea for studying the structural symmetry and functional invariance of complex networks. Along the same line, we systematically investigate the finite-size scaling of structural and dynamical observables in renormalization flows of geometric network models. Our results show that these observables can be well characterized by a certain type of scaling functions. Specifically, we show that the critical exponent implied by the scaling function is independent of these observables but only depends on the small-world properties of the network, namely, all networks located in the small-world phase have a uniform scaling exponent, while those located in the non-small-world phase and in their critical regions have another uniform scaling. Therefore, in a sense this exponent can be used as an effective criterion for classifying geometric models of different universal classes.},

abstract = {Throughout the brain, local circuits encode information using large populations of neurons, yet the structure of this population code remains poorly understood. Previous studies applying the maximum entropy principle to retinal multi-electrode array data have shown that the joint probability distribution of population responses is proliferated by local maxima, which represents a form of clustering of visual stimuli into a discrete set of categories. However, these studies focused on responses to highly repeated stimuli. Another recent study using a hidden Markov model approach likewise found that ganglion cell population activity partitioned into noise-robust clusters. Here, we investigate the relationship between the clusters found using these two fundamentally different modeling approaches. We first demonstrate that local maxima in the probability landscape result from the repeat structure of the stimulus ensemble, and are absent in the more realistic, non-repeated stimulus regime. Nonetheless, we show that structure is still present in the non-repeated stimulus regime in the form of what we call "soft local maxima," which are local maxima within the subspace of all neural activity states that are restricted to have the same spike count. Using a novel numerical approach, we show that soft local maxima are organized into a reliable sequence across the different spike count levels, which altogether has the geometry of a "ridge." These ridges closely corresponded with the clusters formulated by the hidden Markov model, and moreover with neuron "communities," in the sense defined in computer science. These findings suggest a unified description of the retinal population code across different stimulus repeat statistics, and suggest that ridges or communities may be an important feature of the output population activity extracted by visual processing areas downstream of the retina.},

abstract = {How a complex network is connected crucially impacts its dynamics and function. Percolation, the transition to extensive connectedness on gradual addition of links, was long believed to be continuous, but recent numerical evidence of 'explosive percolationg' suggests that it might also be discontinuous if links compete for addition. Here we analyse the microscopic mechanisms underlying discontinuous percolation processes and reveal a strong impact of single-link additions. We show that in generic competitive percolation processes, including those showing explosive percolation, single links do not induce a discontinuous gap in the largest cluster size in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, our results highlight that for large finite systems single links may still induce substantial gaps, because gap sizes scale weakly algebraically with system size. Several essentially macroscopic clusters coexist immediately before the transition, announcing discontinuous percolation. These results explain how single links may drastically change macroscopic connectivity in networks where links add competitively. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, activity fluctuations also appear over a wide range of temporal scales, from days to a few seconds, resulting from the concatenation of a myriad of individual smaller motor events. Furthermore, individuals present di?erent propensity to wakefulness and thus to motor activity throughout the circadian cycle. Are activity fluctuations across temporal scales intrinsically different, or is there a universal description encompassing them? Is this description also universal across individuals, considering the aforementioned variability? Here we establish the presence of universality in motor activity fluctuations based on the empirical study of a month of continuous wristwatch accelerometer recordings. We study the scaling of average fluctuations across temporal scales and determine a universal law characterized by critical exponents $\alpha$, $\tau$ and 1/µ. Results are highly reminiscent of the universality described for the average shape of avalanches in systems exhibiting crackling noise. Beyond its theoretical relevance, the present results can be important for developing objective markers of healthy as well as pathological human motor behavior.},

abstract = {We explore a synaptic plasticity model that incorporates recent findings that potentiation and depression can be induced by precisely timed pairs of synaptic events and postsynaptic spikes. In addition we include the observation that strong synapses undergo relatively less potentiation than weak synapses, whereas depression is independent of synaptic strength. After random stimulation, the synaptic weights reach an equilibrium distribution which is stable, unimodal, and has positive skew. This weight distribution compares favorably to the distributions of quantal amplitudes and of receptor number observed experimentally in central neurons and contrasts to the distribution found in plasticity models without size-dependent potentiation. Also in contrast to those models, which show strong competition between the synapses, stable plasticity is achieved with little competition. Instead, competition can be introduced by including a separate mechanism that scales synaptic strengths multiplicatively as a function of postsynaptic activity. In this model, synaptic weights change in proportion to how correlated they are with other inputs onto the same postsynaptic neuron. These results indicate that stable correlation-based plasticity can be achieved without introducing competition, suggesting that plasticity and competition need not coexist in all circuits or at all developmental stages.},

In this new view, a network failure can be regarded as a percolation process and the critical threshold of percolation can be used as network failure criterion linked to the operational settings under control. To demonstrate our approach, we consider both random network models and real networks with different nodes and/or edges lifetime distributions. We study numerically and theoretically the network reliability and find that the network reliability can be solved as a voting system with threshold given by percolation theory. Then we find that the average lifetime of random network increases linearly with the average lifetime of its nodes with uniform life distributions. Furthermore, the average lifetime of the network becomes saturated when system size is increased. Finally, we demonstrate our method on the transmission network system of IEEE 14 bus.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a centrality measure for networks, which we refer to as Laplacian centrality, that provides a general framework for the centrality of a vertex based on the idea that the importance (or centrality) of a vertex is related to the ability of the network to respond to the deactivation or removal of that vertex from the network. In particular, the Laplacian centrality of a vertex is defined as the relative drop of Laplacian energy caused by the deactivation of this vertex. The Laplacian energy of network G with n vertices is defined as , where is the eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of G. Other dynamics based measures such as that of Masuda and Kori and PageRank compute the importance of a node by analyzing the way paths pass through a node while our measure captures this information as well as the way these paths are “redistributed” when the node is deleted. The validity and robustness of this new measure are illustrated on two different terrorist social network data sets and 84 networks in James Moody's Add Health in school friendship nomination data, and is compared with other standard centrality measures.

The main purpose of this paper is to present general methodology for answering questions related to partial balance in signed networks, and apply it to a range of representative examples that are now analysable because of advances in computational methods. We provide exact numerical results on social and biological signed networks, networks of formal alliances and antagonisms between countries, and financial portfolio networks. Molecular graphs of carbon and Ising models are also considered.

There, the usual order parameter, describing the probability of any node to be part of the largest cluster, jumps instantly to a finite value. Here we provide a simple example in the form of a small-world network consisting of a one-dimensional lattice which, when combined with a hierarchy of long-range bonds, reveals many features of this transition in a mathematically rigorous manner. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into di erent clusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity. Graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting densely connected groups in a large graph. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structure for clustering, but largely ignore the vertex properties which are often heterogenous. In this paper, we propose a novel graph clustering algorithm, SA-Cluster, based on both structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. Our method partitions a large graph associated with attributes into k clusters so that each cluster contains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An e ective method is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural similarity and attribute similarity. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that SA-Cluster is converging. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the e ectiveness of SA-Cluster through comparison with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and summarization methods.},

abstract = {The threat of a malicious attack is one of the major security problems in complex networks. Resilience is the system-level self-adjusting ability of a complex network to retain its basic functionality and recover rapidly from major disruptions. Despite numerous heuristic enhancement methods, there is a research gap in maximizing network resilience: current heuristic methods are designed to immunize vital nodes or modify a network to a specific onion-like structure and cannot maximize resilience theoretically via network structure. Here we map complex networks onto a physical elastic system to introduce indices of network resilience, and propose a unified theoretical framework and general approach, which can address the optimal problem of network resilience by slightly modifying network structures (i.e., by adding a set of structural edges). We demonstrate the high efficiency of this approach on three realistic networks as well as two artificial random networks. Case studies show that the proposed approach can maximize the resilience of complex networks while maintaining their topological functionality. This approach helps to unveil hitherto hidden functions of some inconspicuous components, which in turn, can be used to guide the design of resilient systems, offer an effective and efficient approach for mitigating malicious attacks, and furnish self-healing to reconstruct failed infrastructure systems.},

abstract = {An articulation point (AP) in a network is a node whose deletion would split the network component on which it resides into two or more components. APs are vulnerable spots that play an important role in network collapse processes, which may result from node failures, attacks, or epidemics. Therefore, the abundance and properties of APs affect the resilience of the network to these collapse scenarios. Here we present analytical results for the statistical properties of APs in configuration model networks. In order to quantify the abundance of APs, we calculate the probability P(iAP) that a random node, i, in a configuration model network with a given degree distribution, P(K=k), is an AP. We also obtain the conditional probability P(iAP|k) that a random node of degree k is an AP and find that high-degree nodes are more likely to be APs than low-degree nodes. Using Bayes's theorem, we obtain the conditional degree distribution, P(K=k|AP), over the set of APs and compare it to the overall degree distribution P(K=k). We propose a centrality measure based on APs: Each node can be characterized by its articulation rank, r, which is the number of components that would be added to the network upon deletion of that node. For nodes which are not APs, the articulation rank is r=0, while for APs it satisfies r≥1. We obtain a closed-form analytical expression for the distribution of articulation ranks, P(R=r). Configuration model networks often exhibit a coexistence between a giant component and finite components. While the giant component is extensive in the network size and exhibits cycles, the finite components are nonextensive tree structures. To examine the distinct properties of APs on the giant and on the finite components, we calculate the probabilities presented above separately for the giant and the finite components. We apply these results to ensembles of configuration model networks with degree distributions that follow a Poisson distribution (Erdos-R{\'{e}}nyi networks), an exponential distribution of the form P(K=k)∼e-$\alpha$k, and a power-law distribution of the form P(K=k)∼k-$\gamma$ (scale-free networks), where k≥kmin=1. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of common attack scenarios and network dismantling processes.},

However, there is still a lack of understanding of how community structure affects the systems' resilience and stability. Here, we develop a framework to study the resilience of networks with community structure based on percolation theory. We find both analytically and numerically that the interlinks (connections between the communities) affect the percolation phase transition in a manner similar to an external field in a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic spin system. We also study the universality class by defining the analogous critical exponents {\$}\backslashdelta{\$} and {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}, and find that their values for various models and in real-world co-authors networks follow fundamental scaling relations as in physical phase transitions. The methodology and results presented here not only facilitate the study of resilience of networks but also brings a fresh perspective to the understanding of phase transitions under external fields.},

abstract = {Discovering and characterizing the large-scale topological features in empirical networks are crucial steps in understanding how complex systems function. However, most existing methods used to obtain the modular structure of networks suffer from serious problems, such as being oblivious to the statistical evidence supporting the discovered patterns, which results in the inability to separate actual structure from noise. In addition to this, one also observes a resolution limit on the size of communities, where smaller but well-defined clusters are not detectable when the network becomes large. This phenomenon occurs not only for the very popular approach of modularity optimization, which lacks built-in statistical validation, but also for more principled methods based on statistical inference and model selection, which do incorporate statistical validation in a formally correct way. Here we construct a nested generative model that, through a complete description of the entire network hierarchy at multiple scales, is capable of avoiding this limitation, and enables the detection of modular structure at levels far beyond those possible with current approaches. Even with this increased resolution, the method is based on the principle of parsimony, and is capable of separating signal from noise, and thus will not lead to the identification of spurious modules even on sparse networks. Furthermore, it fully generalizes other approaches in that it is not restricted to purely assortative mixing patterns, directed or undirected graphs, and ad hoc hierarchical structures such as binary trees. Despite its general character, the approach is tractable, and can be combined with advanced techniques of community detection to yield an efficient algorithm that scales well for very large networks.},

To this end, we ask whether triangles in real networks organize as in maximally random graphs with given degree and clustering distributions, or as in maximally ordered graph models where triangles are forced into modules. The answer comes by way of exploring m-core landscapes, where the m-core is defined, akin to the k-core, as the maximal subgraph with edges participating in at least m triangles. This property defines a set of nested subgraphs that, contrarily to k-cores, is able to distinguish between hierarchical and modular architectures. We find that the clustering organization in real networks is neither completely random nor ordered although, surprisingly, it is more random than modular. This supports the idea that the structure of real networks may in fact be the outcome of self-organized processes based on local optimization rules, in contrast to global optimization principles.},

III the author looks at dynamical extensions of basic static classes, showing the effects of mixing dynamics and of percolation. The main body of the review begins in Sec. IV, where genuine, dynamical universality classes specific to nonequilibrium systems are introduced. Section V considers such nonequilibrium classes in coupled, multicomponent systems. Most of the known nonequilibrium transition classes are explored in low dimensions between active and absorbing states of reaction-diffusion-type systems. However, by mapping they can be related to the universal behavior of interface growth models, which are treated in Sec. VI. The review ends with a summary of the classes of absorbing-state and mean-field systems and discusses some possible directions for future research.},

abstract = {We investigate percolation, a probabilistic model for continuous phase transition (CPT), on square and weighted planar stochastic lattices. In its thermal counterpart, entropy is minimally low where order parameter (OP) is maximally high and vice versa. Besides, specific heat, OP and susceptibility exhibit power-law when approaching the critical point and the corresponding critical exponents {\$}\backslashalpha, \backslashbeta, \backslashgamma{\$} respectably obey the Rushbrooke inequality (RI) {\$}\backslashalpha+2\backslashbeta+\backslashgamma\backslashgeq 2{\$}. Their analogues in percolation, however, remain elusive. We define entropy, specific heat and redefine susceptibility for percolation and show that they behave exactly in the same way as their thermal counterpart. We also show that RI holds for both the lattices albeit they belong to different universality classes.},

We present evidence of the occurrence of three classes of small-world networks: (a) scale-free networks, characterized by a vertex connectivity distribution that decays as a power law; (b) broad-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution that has a power law regime followed by a sharp cutoff; and (c) single-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast decaying tail. Moreover, we note for the classes of broad-scale and single-scale networks that there are constraints limiting the addition of new links. Our results suggest that the nature of such constraints may be the controlling factor for the emergence of different classes of networks.},

With this restriction, they obtain that a physically reasonable global solution exists if R kl{\textless}or=rkrl and rk=o(k). It is further conjectured that no gelation will take place if rk=o( square root k). The case Rjk=(Aj+B)(Ak+B) is also solved explicitly and shown to exhibit gelation at t=1/A(A+B).},

@article{McAdams1997,
abstract = {In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such "genetically coupled" link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.},

abstract = {Complex networks from such different fields as biology, technology or sociology share similar organization principles. The possibility of a unique growth mechanism promises to uncover universal origins of collective behaviour. In particular, the emergence of self-similarity in complex networks raises the fundamental question of the growth process according to which these structures evolve. Here we investigate the concept of renormalization as a mechanism for the growth of fractal and non-fractal modular networks. We show that the key principle that gives rise to the fractal architecture of networks is a strong effective 'repulsion' (or, disassortativity) between the most connected nodes (that is, the hubs) on all length scales, rendering them very dispersed. More importantly, we show that a robust network comprising functional modules, such as a cellular network, necessitates a fractal topology, suggestive of an evolutionary drive for their existence.},

These indices are bounded between zero and one, with low values indicating poor transitivity and large ones indicating a high proportion of closed triads in the graphs. Here, we prove that these two indices diverge for windmill graphs when the number of nodes tends to infinity. We also give evidence that this divergence occurs in many real-world networks, especially in citation and collaboration graphs. We obtain analytic expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency and the Laplacian matrices of the windmill graphs. Using this information we show the main characteristics of two dynamical processes when taking place on windmill graphs: synchronization and epidemic spreading. Finally, we show that many of the structural and dynamical properties of a real-world citation network are well reproduced by the appropriate windmill graph, showing the potential of these graphs as models for certain classes of real-world networks.},

abstract = {The function of a real network depends not only on the reliability of its own components, but is affected also by the simultaneous operation of other real networks coupled with it. Robustness of systems composed of interdependent network layers has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the theoretical frameworks developed so far apply only to special models in the limit of infinite sizes. These methods are therefore of little help in practical contexts, given that real interconnected networks have finite size and their structures are generally not compatible with those of graph toy models. Here, we introduce a theoretical method that takes as inputs the adjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the interconnected network, without the need of actually simulating any percolation process. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in arbitrary interdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these system into uncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the layers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected network undergoes a continuous percolation transition. Conversely, if the intersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition becomes abrupt even in systems of finite size. We provide examples of real systems that have developed interdependent networks sharing a core of "high quality" edges to prevent catastrophic failures.},

abstract = {Complex networks have acquired a great popularity in recent years, since the graph representation of many natural, social, and technological systems is often very helpful to characterize and model their phenomenology. Additionally, the mathematical tools of statistical physics have proven to be particularly suitable for studying and understanding complex networks. Nevertheless, an important obstacle to this theoretical approach is still represented by the difficulties to draw parallelisms between network science and more traditional aspects of statistical physics. In this paper, we explore the relation between complex networks and a well known topic of statistical physics: renormalization. A general method to analyze renormalization flows of complex networks is introduced. The method can be applied to study any suitable renormalization transformation. Finite-size scaling can be performed on computer-generated networks in order to classify them in universality classes. We also present applications of the method on real networks.},

abstract = {The centrality of vertices has been a key issue in network analysis. For unweighted networks where edges are just present or absent and have no weight attached, many centrality measures have been presented, such as degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector and subgraph centrality. There has been a growing need to design centrality measures for weighted networks, because weighted networks where edges are attached weights would contain rich information. Some network measures have been proposed for weighted networks, including three common measures of vertex centrality: degree, closeness, and betweenness. In this paper, we propose a new centrality measure called the Laplacian centrality measure for weighted networks. The Laplacian energy is defined as EL(G)=∑ i$\lambda$i2, where $\lambda$ i's are eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of weighted network G. The importance (centrality) of a vertex v is reflected by the drop of the Laplacian energy of the network to respond to the deactivation (deletion) of the vertex from the network. We also prove an algebraic graph theory result that provides a structural description of the Laplacian centrality measure which is in terms of the number of all kinds of 2-walks. Laplacian centrality unveils more structural information about connectivity and density around v (further than its immediate neighborhood). That is, comparing with other standard centrality measures proposed for weighted networks (e.g. degree, closeness or betweenness centrality), Laplacian centrality is an intermediate measuring between global and local characterization of the importance (centrality) of a vertex. We further investigate the validness and robustness of this new centrality measure by illustrating this method to some classical weighted social network data sets and obtain reliable results, which provide strong evidences of the new measure's utility. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It has been developed for more than one century and becomes an extremely huge and seemingly robust system. But it becomes extremely fragile as well because some unexpected minimal failures may lead to sudden and massive blackouts. Many works have been carried out to investigate the structural vulnerability of power grids from the topological point of view based on the complex network theory. This paper focuses on the structural vulnerability of the power grid under the effect of selective node removal. We test the effectiveness of the Laplacian centrality in guiding the node removal based on several IEEE power grids. Simulation results show that, compared with other node centralities such as degree centrality (DC), betweenness centrality (BC) and closeness centrality (CC), Laplacian centrality (LAPC) is effective to guide the node removal and can destroy the power grid in less steps.},

It has been found in [1] that at some critical value µcr, where µ is the chemical potential µ of each closed triple of bonds, evolving networks decays into the maximally possible number of almost full subgraphs, and the spectrum of the adjacency matrix acquires the two-zonal support separated by a wide gap. Studying the level spacing distribution, we demonstrate that in one zone the distribution of gaps between neighboring eigenvalues shares Wigner surmise (i.e. is delocalized), however follows Poisson statistics in the second zone (i.e. is localized). In parallel with evolutionary designed networks, we consider ”instantly” ad hoc prepared networks with in- and cross-cluster probabilities as in the final stage of evolutionary network. For such ”instant” networks eigenvalues are delocalized in both zones. We speculate about the difference in eigenvalue statistics between ”dynamic” and ”static” networks from the perspective of a possible phase transition between ergodic and non-ergodic network patterns with a strong ”memory dependence”, thus advocating existence of non-ergodic delocalized states in the clustered random networks.},

abstract = {The empirical validation of community detection methods is often based on available annotations on the nodes that serve as putative indicators of the large-scale network structure. Most often, the suitability of the annotations as topological descriptors itself is not assessed, and without this it is not possible to ultimately distinguish between actual shortcomings of the community detection algorithms on one hand, and the incompleteness, inaccuracy or structured nature of the data annotations themselves on the other. In this work we present a principled method to access both aspects simultaneously. We construct a joint generative model for the data and metadata, and a non-parametric Bayesian framework to infer its parameters from annotated datasets. We assess the quality of the metadata not according to its direct alignment with the network communities, but rather in its capacity to predict the placement of edges in the network. We also show how this feature can be used to predict the connections to missing nodes when only the metadata is available. By investigating a wide range of datasets, we show that while there are seldom exact agreements between metadata tokens and the inferred data groups, the metadata is often informative of the network structure nevertheless, and can improve the prediction of missing nodes. This shows that the method uncovers meaningful patterns in both the data and metadata, without requiring or expecting a perfect agreement between the two.},

The transition separates a regime in which such methods successfully detect the community structure from one in which the structure is present but is not detected. By comparing these results with recent analyses of maximum-likelihood methods we are able to show that spectral modularity maximization is an optimal detection method in the sense that no other method will succeed in the regime where the modularity method fails.},

At the individual level, we find that the correlations in activity are a byproduct of the clustering expressed in the power-law distribution of inter-event times of single users, i.e. short periods of many events are separated by long periods of no events. On the contrary, the activity of the whole community presents long-term correlations that are a true emergent property of the system, i.e. they are not related to the distribution of inter-event times.

abstract = {Optimal percolation is the problem of finding the minimal set of nodes such that if the members of this set are removed from a network, the network is fragmented into non-extensive disconnected clusters. The solution of the optimal percolation problem has direct applicability in strategies of immunization in disease spreading processes, and influence maximization for certain classes of opinion dynamical models. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal percolation on multiplex networks. The multiplex scenario serves to realistically model various technological, biological, and social networks. We find that the multilayer nature of these systems, and more precisely multiplex characteristics such as edge overlap and interlayer degree-degree correlation, profoundly changes the properties of the set of nodes identified as the solution of the optimal percolation problem.},

abstract = {The network dismantling problem is one of the most fundamental problems in network science. It aims to identify the minimum number of nodes, such that after their removal the network is broken into many disconnected pieces with a sub-extensive size. However, the identification of the minimum removed nodes belongs to the class of nondeterministic polynomial problems. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to identify the removed nodes, the smallest dismantling set remains unknown. Therefore, the determination of a good lower bound of dismantling sets is of great significance to evaluating the performances of heuristic algorithms. The minimum number of deleted nodes to dismantle a network is strictly no smaller than that to dismantle its any subnetwork in nature. Any lower bound of a subnetwork is indeed a lower bound of the original network. Utilizing the heterogeneous degree distribution and 2-core properties, we find that with previous removal of some appropriate nodes, the lower bound obtained on the basis of the subnetwork is counterintuitively significantly better than the one obtained directly on the original network, especially for the real-world networks.
The study of the network dismantlement has attracted much attention of researchers because of its wide practical applications. However, the network dismantling problem is a nondeterministic polynomial (NP) problem and usually approximately solved by heuristic algorithms. The main problem of such heuristic algorithms is that they have no guarantee of their performances. Here, we study the lower bound of the minimum number of deleted nodes to dismantle a network. In particular, we first demonstrate that the lower bound of decycling sets solely based on tree structure is satisfied in the dismantled network. Moreover, the lower bound can be remarkably improved via specific subnetworks due to the scale-free nature of real-world networks. Such lower bound helps evaluate the performance of heuristic algorithms and thus reduce the uncertainty of the optimal solution of the network dismantling problem.},

abstract = {The roles of different nodes within a network are often understood through centrality analysis, which aims to quantify the capacity of a node to influence, or be influenced by, other nodes via its connection topology. Many different centrality measures have been proposed, but the degree to which they offer unique information, and whether it is advantageous to use multiple centrality measures to define node roles, is unclear. Here we calculate correlations between 17 different centrality measures across 212 diverse real-world networks, examine how these correlations relate to variations in network density and global topology, and investigate whether nodes can be clustered into distinct classes according to their centrality profiles. We find that centrality measures are generally positively correlated to each other, the strength of these correlations varies across networks, and network modularity plays a key role in driving these cross-network variations. Data-driven clustering of nodes based on centrality profiles can distinguish different roles, including topological cores of highly central nodes and peripheries of less central nodes. Our findings illustrate how network topology shapes the pattern of correlations between centrality measures and demonstrate how a comparative approach to network centrality can inform the interpretation of nodal roles in complex networks.},

For such systems, we review the physical and mathematical rationale for a discrete-stochastic approach, and for the approximations that need to be made in order to regain the traditional continuous-deterministic description. We next take note of some of the more promising strategies for dealing stochastically with stiff systems, rare events, and sensitivity analysis. Finally, we review some recent efforts to adapt and extend the discrete-stochastic approach to systems that are not well-mixed. In that currently developing area, we focus mainly on the strategy of subdividing the system into well-mixed subvolumes, and then simulating diffusional transfers of reactant molecules between adjacent subvolumes together with chemical reactions inside the subvolumes.},

We conceptualise originality as the degree to which a scientific discovery provides subsequent studies with unique knowledge that is not available from previous studies. Accordingly, we operationalise a new measure of originality for individual scientific papers building on the network betweenness centrality concept. Specifically, we measure the originality of a paper based on the directed citation network between its references and the subsequent papers citing it. We demonstrate the validity of this measure using survey information. In particular, we find that the proposed measure is positively correlated with the self-assessed theoretical originality but not with the methodological originality. We also find that originality can be reliably measured with only a small number of subsequent citing papers, which lowers computational cost and contributes to practical utility. The measure also predicts future citations, further confirming its validity. We further characterise the measure to guide its future use.},

The underlying mechanism of this transition can be described by slow-growing clusters that remain isolated until the later stages of the process, when the addition of a small number of links leads to the rapid interconnection of these modules into a giant cluster. Our results indicate that the evolutionary-based process that shapes the topology of the H-PHN through duplication-divergence events may occur in sudden steps, similarly to what is seen in first-order phase transitions. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences, Societa Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2010.},

Here we identify structural properties of networks that guarantee that random graphs having these properties are geometric. Specifically we show that random graphs in which expected degree and clustering of every node are fixed to some constants are equivalent to random geometric graphs on the real line, if clustering is sufficiently strong. Large numbers of triangles, homogeneously distributed across all nodes as in real networks, are thus a consequence of network geometricity. The methods we use to prove this are quite general and applicable to other network ensembles, geometric or not, and to certain problems in quantum gravity.},

Microscale structures are known to exist in most complex networks (e.g., large number of triangles or motifs), but they are absent in the simple random-graph models considered (e.g., as null models) in community-detection algorithms. In this paper we investigate the effect of microstructures on the appearance of communities in networks. We find that alone the presence of triangles leads to the appearance of communities even in methods designed to avoid the detection of communities in random networks. This shows that communities can emerge spontaneously from simple processes of motiff generation happening at a microlevel. Our results are based on four widely used community-detection approaches (stochastic block model, spectral method, modularity maximization, and the Infomap algorithm) and three different generative network models (triadic closure, generalized configuration model, and random graphs with triangles).},

abstract = {Community detection in graphs is the problem of finding groups of vertices which are more densely connected than they are to the rest of the graph. This problem has a long history, but it is undergoing a resurgence of interest due to the need to analyze social and biological networks. While there are many ways to formalize it, one of the most popular is as an inference problem, where there is a "ground truth" community structure built into the graph somehow. The task is then to recover the ground truth knowing only the graph. Recently it was discovered, first heuristically in physics and then rigorously in probability and computer science, that this problem has a phase transition at which it suddenly becomes impossible. Namely, if the graph is too sparse, or the probabilistic process that generates it is too noisy, then no algorithm can find a partition that is correlated with the planted one---or even tell if there are communities, i.e., distinguish the graph from a purely random one with high probability. Above this information-theoretic threshold, there is a second threshold beyond which polynomial-time algorithms are known to succeed; in between, there is a regime in which community detection is possible, but conjectured to require exponential time. For computer scientists, this field offers a wealth of new ideas and open questions, with connections to probability and combinatorics, message-passing algorithms, and random matrix theory. Perhaps more importantly, it provides a window into the cultures of statistical physics and statistical inference, and how those cultures think about distributions of instances, landscapes of solutions, and hardness.},

Despite the CNDP being recognized as a bi-objective problem, until now only single-objective problem formulations have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a bi-objective version of the problem that aims to maximize the number of connected components in a graph while simultaneously minimizing the variance of their cardinalities by removing a subset of K nodes. We prove that our bi-objective formulation is distinct from the CNDP, despite their common motivation. Finally, we give a brief comparison of six common multi-objective evolutionary algorithms using sixteen common benchmark problem instances, including for the node-weighted CNDP. We find that of the examined algorithms, NSGAII generally produces the most desirable approximation fronts.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society.In this article, we investigate both site and bond percolation on a weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL), which is a multifractal and whose dual is a scale-free network. The characteristic property of percolation is that it exhibits threshold phenomena as we find sudden or abrupt jump in spanning probability across pc accompanied by the divergence of some other observable quantities, which is reminiscent of a continuous phase transition. Indeed, percolation is characterized by the critical behavior of percolation strength P(p)∼(pc-p)$\beta$, mean cluster size S∼(pc-p)-$\gamma$, and the system size L∼(pc-p)-$\nu$, which are known as the equivalent counterpart of the order parameter, susceptibility, and correlation length, respectively. Moreover, the cluster size distribution function ns(pc)∼s-$\tau$ and the mass-length relation M∼Ldf of the spanning cluster also provide useful characterization of the percolation process. We numerically obtain a value for pc and for all the exponents such as $\beta$,$\nu$,$\gamma$,$\tau$, and df. We find that, except for pc, all the exponents are exactly the same in both bond and site percolation despite the significant difference in the definition of cluster and other quantities. Our results suggest that the percolation on WPSL belongs to a new universality class, as its exponents do not share the same value as for all the existing planar lattices. Besides, like all other cases, its site and bond type belong to the same universality class.},

abstract = {Discontinuous percolation transitions and the associated tricritical points are manifest in a wide range of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium cooperative phenomena. To demonstrate this, we present and relate the continuous and first-order behaviors in two different classes of models: The first are generalized epidemic processes that describe in their spatially embedded version-either on or off a regular lattice-compact or fractal cluster growth in random media at zero temperature. A random graph version of these processes is mapped onto a model previously proposed for complex social contagion. We compute detailed phase diagrams and compare our numerical results at the tricritical point in d=3 with field theory predictions of Janssen. The second class consists of exponential ("Hamiltonian," i.e., formally equilibrium) random graph models and includes the Strauss and the two-star model, where "chemical potentials" control the densities of links, triangles, or two-stars. When the chemical potentials in either graph model are O(logN), the percolation transition can coincide with a first-order phase transition in the density of links, making the former also discontinuous. Hysteresis loops can then be of mixed order, with second-order behavior for decreasing link fugacity, and a jump (first order) when it increases. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The control of complex networks is of paramount importance in areas as diverse as ecosystem management, emergency response, and cell reprogramming. A fundamental property of networks is that perturbations to one node can affect other nodes, potentially causing the entire system to change behavior or fail. Here, we show that it is possible to exploit the same principle to control network behavior. Our approach accounts for the nonlinear dynamics inherent to real systems, and allows bringing the system to a desired target state even when this state is not directly accessible due to constraints that limit the allowed interventions. Applications show that this framework permits reprogramming a network to a desired task as well as rescuing networks from the brink of failure---which we illustrate through the mitigation of cascading failures in a power-grid network and the identification of potential drug targets in a signaling network of human cancer.},

The effectiveness of disruption strategies is known to depend on both network topology and network resilience. However, as these criminal networks operate in secrecy, data-driven knowledge concerning the effectiveness of different criminal network disruption strategies is very limited. By combining computational modeling and social network analysis with unique criminal network intelligence data from the Dutch Police, we discovered, in contrast to common belief, that criminal networks might even become 'stronger', after targeted attacks. On the other hand increased efficiency within criminal networks decreases its internal security, thus offering opportunities for law enforcement agencies to target these networks more deliberately. Our results emphasize the importance of criminal network interventions at an early stage, before the network gets a chance to (re-)organize to maximum resilience. In the end disruption strategies force criminal networks to become more exposed, which causes successful network disruption to become a long-term effort.},

abstract = {Percolation and synchronization are two phase transitions that have been extensively studied since already long ago. A classic result is that, in the vast majority of cases, these transitions are of the second-order type, i.e. continuous and reversible. Recently, however, explosive phenomena have been reported in complex networks' structure and dynamics, which rather remind first-order (discontinuous and irreversible) transitions. Explosive percolation, which was discovered in 2009, corresponds to an abrupt change in the network's structure, and explosive synchronization (which is concerned, instead, with the abrupt emergence of a collective state in the networks' dynamics) was studied as early as the first models of globally coupled phase oscillators were taken into consideration. The two phenomena have stimulated investigations and debates, attracting attention in many relevant fields. So far, various substantial contributions and progresses (including experimental verifications) have been made, which have provided insights on what structural and dynamical properties are needed for inducing such abrupt transformations, as well as have greatly enhanced our understanding of phase transitions in networked systems. Our intention is to offer here a monographic review on the main-stream literature, with the twofold aim of summarizing the existing results and pointing out possible directions for future research.},

abstract = {Lasting alterations in sensory input trigger massive structural and functional adaptations in cortical networks. The principles governing these experience-dependent changes are, however, poorly understood. Here, we examine whether a simple rule based on the neurons' need for homeostasis in electrical activity may serve as driving force for cortical reorganization. According to this rule, a neuron creates new spines and boutons when its level of electrical activity is below a homeostatic set-point and decreases the number of spines and boutons when its activity exceeds this set-point. In addition, neurons need a minimum level of activity to form spines and boutons. Spine and bouton formation depends solely on the neuron's own activity level, and synapses are formed by merging spines and boutons independently of activity. Using a novel computational model, we show that this simple growth rule produces neuron and network changes as observed in the visual cortex after focal retinal lesions. In the model, as in the cortex, the turnover of dendritic spines was increased strongest in the center of the lesion projection zone, while axonal boutons displayed a marked overshoot followed by pruning. Moreover, the decrease in external input was compensated for by the formation of new horizontal connections, which caused a retinotopic remapping. Homeostatic regulation may provide a unifying framework for understanding cortical reorganization, including network repair in degenerative diseases or following focal stroke.},

As a function of the degrees of two vertices interconnected by the edge and the size of the component to which the edge belongs, the formula can give an estimation of the mean value of the edge betweenness. We confirm the formula by simulations for Poisson and power law distributions respectively. We also study the asymptotic behavior of the formula and find that there is an asymptotic power law relation with an exponent 1.5 between the edge betweenness and the size of the component to which the edge belongs. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The dynamical properties of a variety of systems can be understood in terms of percolation, including the robustness of power grids and information networks, the spreading of epidemics and forest fires, and the stability of gene regulatory networks. Recent studies have shown that if network edges are added "competitively" in undirected networks, the onset of percolation is abrupt or "explosive. " The unusual qualitative features of this phase transition have been the subject of much recent attention. Here we generalize this previously studied network growth process from undirected networks to directed networks and use finite-size scaling theory to find several scaling exponents. We find that this process is also characterized by a very rapid growth in the giant component, but that this growth is not as sudden as in undirected networks. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

We show that there exists a critical time t(c) above which the giant susceptible component is destroyed. As a consequence, in order to preserve a macroscopic connected fraction of the network composed by healthy individuals which guarantee its functionality, any mitigation strategy should be implemented before this critical time t(c).

In this paper, starting from a percolation perspective, we develop two strategies, the relationship-related (RR) strategy and the prediction relationship (PR) strategy, to avoid a local optimum only through the investigation of interrelationships among nodes. Meanwhile, RR combines the sum rule and the product rule from explosive percolation, and PR holds the assumption that nodes with high degree are usually more important than those with low degree. In this manner our methods have a better capability to collapse or protect a network. The simulations performed on a number of networks also demonstrate their effectiveness, especially on large real-world networks where RR fragments each of them into the same size of the giant component; however, RR needs only less than 90{\%} of the number of nodes which are necessary for the most excellent existing methods.},

abstract = {Influence maximization is the problem of finding the set of nodes of a network that maximizes the size of the outbreak of a spreading process occurring on the network. Solutions to this problem are important for strategic decisions in marketing and political campaigns. The typical setting consists in the identification of small sets of initial spreaders in very large networks. This setting makes the optimization problem computationally infeasible for standard greedy optimization algorithms that account simultaneously for information about network topology and spreading dynamics, leaving space only to heuristic methods based on the drastic approximation of relying on the geometry of the network alone. The literature on the subject is plenty of purely topological methods for the identification of influential spreaders in networks. However, it is unclear how far these methods are from being optimal. Here, we perform a systematic test of the performance of a multitude of heuristic methods for the identification of influential spreaders. We quantify the performance of the various methods on a corpus of 100 real-world networks; the corpus consists of networks small enough for the application of greedy optimization so that results from this algorithm are used as the baseline needed for the analysis of the performance of the other methods on the same corpus of networks. We find that relatively simple network metrics, such as adaptive degree or closeness centralities, are able to achieve performances very close to the baseline value, thus providing good support for the use of these metrics in large-scale problem settings. Also, we show that a further 2–5{\%} improvement towards the baseline performance is achievable by hybrid algorithms that combine two or more topological metrics together. This final result is validated on a small collection of large graphs where greedy optimization is not applicable.},

There is a demand for versatile, stochastic modeling environments with extensive, preprogrammed statistics functions and plotting capabilities that hide the mathematics from the novice users and offers low-level programming access to the experienced user. Here we present StochPy (Stochastic modeling in Python), which is a flexible software tool for stochastic simulation in cell biology. It provides various stochastic simulation algorithms, SBML support, analyses of the probability distributions of molecule copy numbers and event waiting times, analyses of stochastic time series, and a range of additional statistical functions and plotting facilities for stochastic simulations. We illustrate the functionality of StochPy with stochastic models of gene expression, cell division, and single-molecule enzyme kinetics. StochPy has been successfully tested against the SBML stochastic test suite, passing all tests. StochPy is a comprehensive software package for stochastic simulation of the molecular control networks of living cells. It allows novice and experienced users to study stochastic phenomena in cell biology.

However, hidden in this skewed global distribution, we discover a qualitatively different and considerably less biased link distribution among subcategories of pages-for example, among all university homepages or all newspaper homepages. Although the connectivity distribution over the entire web is close to a pure power law, we find that the distribution within specific categories is typically unimodal on a log scale, with the location of the mode, and thus the extent of the rich get richer phenomenon, varying across different categories. Similar distributions occur in many other naturally occurring networks, including research paper citations, movie actor collaborations, and United States power grid connections. A simple generative model, incorporating a mixture of preferential and uniform attachment, quantifies the degree to which the rich nodes grow richer, and how new (and poorly connected) nodes can compete. The model accurately accounts for the true connectivity distributions of category-specific web pages, the web as a whole, and other social networks.},

abstract = {Many infrastructure networks have a modular structure and are also interdependent. While significant research has explored the resilience of interdependent networks, there has been no analysis of the effects of modularity. Here we develop a theoretical framework for attacks on interdependent modular networks and support our results by simulations. We focus on the case where each network has the same number of communities and the dependency links are restricted to be between pairs of communities of different networks. This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city has its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within the city. However, each infrastructure is connected within and between cities. For example, a power grid will connect many cities as will a communication network, yet a power station and communication tower that are interdependent will likely be in the same city. It has been shown that single networks are very susceptible to the failure of the interconnected nodes (between communities) Shai et al. and that attacks on these nodes are more crippling than attacks based on betweenness da Cunha et al. In our example of cities these nodes have long range links which are more likely to fail. For both treelike and looplike interdependent modular networks we find distinct regimes depending on the number of modules, {\$}m{\$}. (i) In the case where there are fewer modules with strong intraconnections, the system first separates into modules in an abrupt first-order transition and then each module undergoes a second percolation transition. (ii) When there are more modules with many interconnections between them, the system undergoes a single transition. Overall, we find that modular structure can influence the type of transitions observed in interdependent networks and should be considered in attempts to make interdependent networks more resilient.},

abstract = {How universal is human conceptual structure? The way concepts are organized in the human brain may reflect distinct features of cultural, historical, and environmental background in addition to properties universal to human cognition. Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides direct access to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously difficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here we provide an empirical measure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic dictionaries. Across languages carefully selected from a phylogenetically and geographically stratified sample of genera, translations of words reveal cases where a particular language uses a single polysemous word to express concepts represented by distinct words in another. We use the frequency of polysemies linking two concepts as a measure of their semantic proximity, and represent the pattern of such linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly uneven and fragmented: certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than others, and there emerge naturally interpretable clusters loosely connected to each other. Statistical analysis shows such structural properties are consistent across different language groups, largely independent of geography, environment, and literacy. It is therefore possible to conclude the conceptual structure connecting basic vocabulary studied is primarily due to universal features of human cognition and language use.},

Most real networks tend to be very fragile to high betweenness adaptive attacks. However, recent contributions have shown the importance of interconnected nodes in the integrity of networks and modulebased attacks have appeared promising when compared to traditional malicious nonadaptive attacks. In the present work we deeply explore the tradeoff associated with attack procedures, introducing a generalized robustness measure and presenting an attack performance index that takes into account both robustness of the network against the attack and the runtime needed to obtained the list of targeted nodes for the attack. Besides, we introduce the concept of deactivation point aimed to mark the point at which the network stops to function properly. We then show empirically that nonadaptive modulebased attacks perform better than high degree and betweenness adaptive attacks in networks with well defined community structures and consequent high modularity.},

The percolation phase transitions were believed to be continuous until recently when in a new so-called "explosive percolation" problem for a competition driven process, a discontinuous phase transition was reported. The analysis of evolution equations for this process showed however that this transition is actually continuous though with surprisingly tiny critical exponents. For a wide class of representative models, we develop a strict scaling theory of this exotic transition which provides the full set of scaling functions and critical exponents. This theory indicates the relevant order parameter and susceptibility for the problem, and explains the continuous nature of this transition and its unusual properties.},

Each node is associated with, or "attracted" to its neighbor of maximal degree, as long as the degree is increasing. A node that has no neighbors of higher degree is a peak, attracting all the nodes in its basin. Maximally random scale-free networks exhibit different behavior based on their degree distribution exponent gamma : For small gamma (broad distribution) networks are dominated by a giant basin, whereas for large gamma (narrow distribution) there are numerous basins, with peaks attracting mainly their nearest neighbors. We derive expressions for the first two moments of the number of basins. We also obtain the complete distribution of basin sizes for a class of hierarchical deterministic scale-free networks that resemble random nets. Finally, we generalize the problem to regular networks and lattices where all degrees are equal, and thus the attractiveness of a node must be determined by an assigned weight, rather than the degree. We derive the complete distribution of basins of attraction resulting from randomly assigned weights in one-dimensional chains.},

abstract = {Percolation is the simplest fundamental model in statistical mechanics that exhibits phase transitions signaled by the emergence of a giant connected component. Despite its very simple rules, percolation theory has successfully been applied to describe a large variety of natural, technological and social systems. Percolation models serve as important universality classes in critical phenomena characterized by a set of critical exponents which correspond to a rich fractal and scaling structure of their geometric features. We will first outline the basic features of the ordinary model. Over the years a variety of percolation models has been introduced some of which with completely different scaling and universal properties from the original model with either continuous or discontinuous transitions depending on the control parameter, dimensionality and the type of the underlying rules and networks. We will try to take a glimpse at a number of selective variations including Achlioptas process, half-restricted process and spanning cluster-avoiding process as examples of the so-called explosive percolation. We will also introduce non-self-averaging percolation and discuss correlated percolation and bootstrap percolation with special emphasis on their recent progress. Directed percolation process will be also discussed as a prototype of systems displaying a nonequilibrium phase transition into an absorbing state. In the past decade, after the invention of stochastic L{\"{o}}wner evolution (SLE) by Oded Schramm, two-dimensional (2D) percolation has become a central problem in probability theory leading to the two recent Fields medals. After a short review on SLE, we will provide an overview on existence of the scaling limit and conformal invariance of the critical percolation. We will also establish a connection with the magnetic models based on the percolation properties of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn and geometric spin clusters. As an application we will discuss how percolation theory leads to the reduction of the 3D criticality in a 3D Ising model to a 2D critical behavior. Another recent application is to apply percolation theory to study the properties of natural and artificial landscapes. We will review the statistical properties of the coastlines and watersheds and their relations with percolation. Their fractal structure and compatibility with the theory of SLE will also be discussed. The present mean sea level on Earth will be shown to coincide with the critical threshold in a percolation description of the global topography.},

abstract = {Percolation is a paradigmatic model in disordered systems and has been applied to various natural phenomena. The percolation transition is known as one of the most robust continuous transitions. However, recent extensive studies have revealed that a few models exhibit a discontinuous percolation transition (DPT) in cluster merging processes. Unlike the case of continuous transitions, understanding the nature of discontinuous phase transitions requires a detailed study of the system at hand, which has not been undertaken yet for DPTs. Here we examine the cluster size distribution immediately before an abrupt increase in the order parameter of DPT models and find that DPTs induced by cluster merging kinetics can be classified into two types. Moreover, the type of DPT can be determined by the key characteristic of whether the cluster kinetic rule is homogeneous with respect to the cluster sizes. We also establish the necessary conditions for each type of DPT, which can be used effectively when the discontinuity of the order parameter is ambiguous, as in the explosive percolation model.},

abstract = {The community structure and the robustness are two important properties of networks for analyzing the functionality of complex systems. The community structure is crucial to understand the potential functionality of complex systems, while the robustness is indispensable to protect the functionality of complex systems from malicious attacks. When a network suffers from an unpredictable attack, its structural integrity would be damaged. Earlier studies focused on the integrity of the node structure or the edge structure when a network suffers from a single-level malicious attack on the nodes or the edges. In this study, we model the attack on the network as a two-level targeted one. Then, we propose a community robustness index to evaluate the integrality of the community structure when the network suffers from the modeled attack. The proposed index plays an important role in analyzing the ability of the real systems to resist unpredictable failures. Finally, based on the proposed community robustness index, a greedy algorithm is devised to mitigate the network attack. Experiments on three real network systems show that with minor changes in links the community robustness of networks can be greatly improved. The results also demonstrate that the community structures in the optimized networks remain practically unchanged compared with the original ones.},

Part of the problem is the lack of a similarity measure for the comparison of hierarchical community structures. In this work we give a contribution by introducing the {\{}$\backslash$it hierarchical mutual information{\}}, which is a generalization of the traditional mutual information, and allows to compare hierarchical partitions and hierarchical community structures. The {\{}$\backslash$it normalized{\}} version of the hierarchical mutual information should behave analogously to the traditional normalized mutual information. Here, the correct behavior of the hierarchical mutual information is corroborated on an extensive battery of numerical experiments. The experiments are performed on artificial hierarchies, and on the hierarchical community structure of artificial and empirical networks. Furthermore, the experiments illustrate some of the practical applications of the hierarchical mutual information. Namely, the comparison of different community detection methods, and the study of the the consistency, robustness and temporal evolution of the hierarchical modular structure of networks.},

To model the effects of this increase, it is crucial to understand whether possible self-organized patterns are inherent in the global road network structure. Here, we use the largest updated database comprising all major roads on the Earth, together with global urban and cropland inventories, to suggest that road length distributions within croplands are indistinguishable from urban ones, once rescaled to account for the difference in mean road length. Such similarity extends to road length distributions within urban or agricultural domains of a given area. We find two distinct regimes for the scaling of the mean road length with the associated area, holding in general at small and at large values of the latter. In suitably large urban and cropland domains, we find that mean and total road lengths increase linearly with their domain area, differently fromearlier suggestions. Scaling regimes suggest that simple and universal mechanisms regulate urban and cropland road expansion at the global scale. As such, our findings bear implications for global road infrastructure growth based on land-use change and for planning policies sustaining urban expansions.},

The framework of fractal networks is useful in understanding the utility and the redundancy in networked systems.},

To identify vital nodes is thus very significant, allowing us to control the outbreak of epidemics, to conduct advertisements for e-commercial products, to predict popular scientific publications, and so on. The vital nodes identification attracts increasing attentions from both computer science and physical societies, with algorithms ranging from simply counting the immediate neighbors to complicated machine learning and message passing approaches. In this review, we clarify the concepts and metrics, classify the problems and methods, as well as review the important progresses and describe the state of the art. Furthermore, we provide extensive empirical analyses to compare well-known methods on disparate real networks, and highlight the future directions. In spite of the emphasis on physics-rooted approaches, the unification of the language and comparison with cross-domain methods would trigger interdisciplinary solutions in the near future.},

abstract = {A practical approach to protecting networks against epidemic processes such as spreading of infectious diseases, malware, and harmful viral information is to remove some influential nodes beforehand to fragment the network into small components. Because determining the optimal order to remove nodes is a computationally hard problem, various approximate algorithms have been proposed to efficiently fragment networks by sequential node removal. Morone and Makse proposed an algorithm employing the non-backtracking matrix of given networks, which outperforms various existing algorithms with a reasonable computational cost. In fact, many empirical networks have community structure, compromising the assumption of local tree-like structure on which the original algorithm is based. We develop an immunization algorithm by synergistically combining the Morone-Makse algorithm and coarse graining of the network in which we regard a community as a supernode. The proposed algorithm works more efficiently than the Morone-Makse and other algorithms on networks with community structure.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been carried out to study standard and inverse bond percolation of straight rigid rods on square lattices. In the case of standard percolation, the lattice is initially empty. Then, linear bond k-mers (sets of k linear nearest-neighbor bonds) are randomly and sequentially deposited on the lattice. Jamming coverage pj,
k and percolation threshold pc, k are determined for a wide range of k (1≤k≤120). pj,k and p
c,k exhibit a decreasing behavior with increasing k, pj,
k→∞=0.7476(1) and pc,k→∞=0.0033(9) being the limit values for large k-mer sizes. pj,k is always greater than 
pc,k, and consequently, the percolation phase transition occurs for all values of k. In the case of inverse percolation, the process starts with an initial configuration where all lattice bonds are occupied and, given that periodic boundary conditions are used, the opposite sides of the lattice are connected by nearest-neighbor occupied bonds. Then, the system is diluted by randomly removing linear bond 
k-mers from the lattice. The central idea here is based on finding the maximum concentration of occupied bonds (minimum concentration of empty bonds) for which connectivity disappears. This particular value of concentration is called the inverse percolation threshold pic,k, and determines a geometrical phase transition in the system. On the other hand, the inverse jamming coverage pij,k is the coverage of the limit state, in which no more objects can be removed from the lattice due to the absence of linear clusters of nearest-neighbor bonds of appropriate size. It is easy to understand that pij,k=1−pj,k. The obtained results for pic,k show that the inverse percolation threshold is a decreasing function of k in the range 1≤k≤18. For k{\textgreater}18, all jammed configurations are ercolating states, and consequently, there is no nonpercolating phase. In other words, the lattice remains connected even when the highest allowed concentration of removed bonds pij,k is reached. In terms of network attacks, this striking behavior indicates that random attacks on single nodes (
k=1) are much more effective than correlated attacks on groups of close nodes (large 
k's). Finally, the accurate determination of critical exponents reveals that standard and inverse bond percolation models on square lattices belong to the same universality class as the random percolation, regardless of the size k  considered.},

abstract = {Universality is a principle that fundamentally underlies many critical phenomena, ranging from epidemic spreading to the emergence or breakdown of global connectivity in networks. Percolation, the transition to global connectedness on gradual addition of links, may exhibit substantial gaps in the size of the largest connected network component. We uncover that the largest gap statistics is governed by extreme-value theory. This allows us to unify continuous and discontinuous percolation by virtue of universal critical scaling functions, obtained from normal and extreme-value statistics. Specifically, we show that the universal scaling function of the size of the largest gap is given by the extreme-value Gumbel distribution. This links extreme-value statistics to universality and criticality in percolation.},

abstract = {SignificanceThe wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web is a fruitful environment for the massive diffusion of unverified rumors. In this work, using a massive quantitative analysis of Facebook, we show that information related to distinct narratives--conspiracy theories and scientific news--generates homogeneous and polarized communities (i.e., echo chambers) having similar information consumption patterns. Then, we derive a data-driven percolation model of rumor spreading that demonstrates that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades size. The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15--where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., "echo chambers." Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades size.},

abstract = {The Elo system for rating chess players, also used in other games and sports, was adopted by the World Chess Federation over four decades ago. Although not without controversy, it is accepted as generally reliable and provides a method for assessing players' strengths and ranking them in official tournaments. It is generally accepted that the distribution of players' rating data is approximately normal but, to date, no stochastic model of how the distribution might have arisen has been proposed. We propose such an evolutionary stochastic model, which models the arrival of players into the rating pool, the games they play against each other, and how the results of these games affect their ratings, in a similar manner to the Elo system. Using a continuous approximation to the discrete model, we derive the distribution for players' ratings at time t as a normal distribution, where the variance increases in time as a logarithmic function of t. We validate the model using published rating data from 2007-2010, showing that the parameters obtained from the data can be recovered through simulations of the stochastic model. The distribution of players' ratings is only approximately normal and has been shown to have a small negative skew. We show how to modify our evolutionary stochastic model to take this skewness into account, and we validate the modified model using the published official rating data.},

In this paper we move a further step beyond random node deletion by considering that a node can be deleted because it is chosen or because it is within some L-hop distance of a chosen node. Using the generating functions approach, we present analytic results on the percolation threshold as well as the mean size, and size distribution, of nongiant components of complex networks under such operations. The introduction of parameter L is both conceptually interesting because it accommodates a sort of nonindependent node deletion, which is often difficult to tackle analytically, and practically interesting because it offers useful insights for cybersecurity (such as botnet defense). {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

State-of-the-art engines now provide an authoritative judgement that can be used in many applications like cheating detection, intrinsic ratings computation, skill assessment, or the study of human decision-making. A key issue for the research community is to gather a large dataset of chess games together with the judgement of chess engines. Unfortunately the analysis of each move takes lots of times. In this paper, we report our effort to analyse almost 5 millions chess games with a computing grid. During summer 2015, we processed 270 millions unique played positions using the Stockfish engine with a quite high depth (20). We populated a database of 1+ tera-octets of chess evaluations, representing an estimated time of 50 years of computation on a single machine. Our effort is a first step towards the replication of research results, the supply of open data and procedures for exploring new directions, and the investigation of software engineering/scalability issues when computing billions of moves.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society.Some real-world networks are shown to be fractal or self-similar. It is widespread that such a phenomenon originates from the repulsion between hubs or disassortativity. Here we show that this common belief fails to capture the causality. Our key insight to address it is to pinpoint links critical to fractality. Those links with small edge betweenness centrality (BC) constitute a special architecture called fractal reference system, which gives birth to the fractal structure of those reported networks. In contrast, a small amount of links with high BC enable small-world effects, hiding the intrinsic fractality. With enough of such links removed, fractal scaling spontaneously arises from nonfractal networks. Our results provide a multiple-scale view on the structure and dynamics and place fractality as a generic organizing principle of complex networks on a firmer ground.},

It is a measure that quantifies the importance of a vertex based on the vertex's occurrence on shortest paths in a graph. This is a global measure, and in order to find the betweenness centrality of a node, one is supposed to have complete information about the graph. Most of the algorithms that are used to find betweenness centrality assume the constancy of the graph and are not efficient for dynamic networks. We propose a technique to update betweenness centrality of a graph when nodes are added or deleted. Observed experimentally, for real graphs, our algorithm speeds up the calculation of betweenness centrality from 7 to 412 times in comparison to the currently best-known techniques.},

abstract = {Fractal scaling--a power-law behavior of the number of boxes needed to tile a given network with respect to the lateral size of the box--is studied. We introduce a new box-covering algorithm that is a modified version of the original algorithm introduced by Song et al. [Nature (London) 433, 392 (2005)]; this algorithm enables effective computation and easy implementation. Fractal networks are viewed as comprising a skeleton and shortcuts. The skeleton, embedded underneath the original network, is a special type of spanning tree based on the edge betweenness centrality; it provides a scaffold for the fractality of the network. When the skeleton is regarded as a branching tree, it exhibits a plateau in the mean branching number as a function of the distance from a root. Based on these observations, we construct a fractal network model by combining a random branching tree and local shortcuts. The scaffold branching tree can be either critical or supercritical, depending on the small-worldness of a given network. For the network constructed from the critical (supercritical) branching tree, the average number of vertices within a given box grows with the lateral size of the box according to a power-law (an exponential) form in the cluster-growing method. The distribution of box masses, i.e., the number of vertices within each box, follows a power law P{\_}m(M) sim M{\^{}}{\{}-eta{\}}. The exponent eta depends on the box lateral size ell{\_}B. For small values of ell{\_}B, eta is equal to the degree exponent gamma of a given scale-free network, whereas eta approaches the exponent tau=gamma/(gamma-1) as ell{\_}B increases, which is the exponent of the cluster-size distribution of the random branching tree. We also study the perimeter of a given box as a function of the box mass.},

abstract = {The emergence of large-scale connectivity and synchronization are crucial to the structure, function and failure of many complex socio-technical networks. Thus, there is great interest in analyzing phase transitions to large-scale connectivity and to global synchronization, including how to enhance or delay the onset. These phenomena are traditionally studied as second-order phase transitions where, at the critical threshold, the order parameter increases rapidly but continuously. In 2009, an extremely abrupt transition was found for a network growth process where links compete for addition in attempt to delay percolation. This observation of "explosive percolation" was ultimately revealed to be a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit, yet with very atypical finite-size scaling, and it started a surge of work on explosive phenomena and their consequences. Many related models are now shown to yield discontinuous percolation transitions and even hybrid transitions. Explosive percolation enables many other features such as multiple giant components, modular structures, discrete scale invariance and non-self-averaging, relating to properties found in many real phenomena such as explosive epidemics, electric breakdowns and the emergence of molecular life. Models of explosive synchronization provide an analytic framework for the dynamics of abrupt transitions and reveal the interplay between the distribution in natural frequencies and the network structure, with applications ranging from epileptic seizures to waking from anesthesia. Here we review the vast literature on explosive phenomena and synthesize the fundamental connections between models and survey the application areas. We attempt to classify explosive phenomena based on underlying mechanisms and to provide a coherent overview and perspective for future research to address the many vital questions that remained unanswered.},

abstract = {In the last 15 years, statistical physics has been a very successful framework to model complex networks. On the theoretical side, this approach has brought novel insights into a variety of physical phenomena, such as self-organisation, scale invariance, emergence of mixed distributions and ensemble non-equivalence, that display unconventional features on heterogeneous networks. At the same time, thanks to their deep connection with information theory, statistical physics and the principle of maximum entropy have led to the definition of null models for networks reproducing some features of real-world systems, but otherwise as random as possible. We review here the statistical physics approach and the various null models for complex networks, focusing in particular on the analytic frameworks reproducing the local network features. We then show how these models have been used to detect statistically significant and predictive structural patterns in real-world networks, as well as to reconstruct the network structure in case of incomplete information. We further survey the statistical physics models that reproduce more complex, semi-local network features using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, as well as the models of generalised network structures such as multiplex networks, interacting networks and simplicial complexes.},

abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

Recently, an explosive percolation (EP) model was introduced to understand such phenomena. The order of the EP transition has not been clarified in a unified framework covering low-dimensional systems and the mean-field limit. We introduce a stochastic model in which a rule for dynamics is designed to avoid the formation of a spanning cluster through competitive selection in Euclidean space. We use heuristic arguments to show that in the thermodynamic limit and depending on a control parameter, the EP transition can be either continuous or discontinuous if d {\textless} d(c) and is always continuous if d ≥ d(c), where d(c) is the spatial dimension and d is the upper critical dimension.},

In addition to the standard but unrealistic case of fixed infectiveness time and fixed and uncorrelated probability of transmission between all pairs of individuals, we solve cases in which times and probabilities are non-uniform and correlated. We also consider one simple case of an epidemic in a structured population, that of a sexually transmitted disease in a population divided into men and women.

Current methods of network comparison are limited to extract only partial information or are computationally very demanding. Here we propose an efficient and precise measure for network comparison, which is based on quantifying differences among distance probability distributions extracted from the networks. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks show that this measure returns non-zero values only when the graphs are non-isomorphic. Most importantly, the measure proposed here can identify and quantify structural topological differences that have a practical impact on the information flow through the network, such as the presence or absence of critical links that connect or disconnect connected components.},

While extensive approaches---such as the state-of-the-art Message Passing Approach---typically yield more accurate predictions, intensive approaches provide crucial insights on the role played by any given structural property in the outcome of dynamical processes. Here we introduce an intensive description that yields almost identical predictions to the ones obtained with MPA for bond percolation. Our approach distinguishes nodes according to two simple statistics: their degree and their position in the core-periphery organization of the network. Our near-exact predictions highlight how accurately capturing the long-range correlations in network structures allows to easily and effectively compress real complex network data.},

abstract = {How a complex network is connected crucially impacts its dynamics and function. Percolation, the transition to extensive connectedness on gradual addition of links, was long believed to be continuous, but recent numerical evidence of 'explosive percolationg' suggests that it might also be discontinuous if links compete for addition. Here we analyse the microscopic mechanisms underlying discontinuous percolation processes and reveal a strong impact of single-link additions. We show that in generic competitive percolation processes, including those showing explosive percolation, single links do not induce a discontinuous gap in the largest cluster size in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, our results highlight that for large finite systems single links may still induce substantial gaps, because gap sizes scale weakly algebraically with system size. Several essentially macroscopic clusters coexist immediately before the transition, announcing discontinuous percolation. These results explain how single links may drastically change macroscopic connectivity in networks where links add competitively. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The rising attention to the spreading of fake news and unsubstantiated rumors on online social media and the pivotal role played by confirmation bias led researchers to investigate different aspects of the phenomenon. Experimental evidence showed that confirmatory information gets accepted even if containing deliberately false claims while dissenting information is mainly ignored or might even increase group polarization. It seems reasonable that, to address misinformation problem properly, we have to understand the main determinants behind content consumption and the emergence of narratives on online social media. In this paper we address such a challenge by focusing on the discussion around the Italian Constitutional Referendum by conducting a quantitative, cross-platform analysis on both Facebook public pages and Twitter accounts. We observe the spontaneous emergence of well-separated communities on both platforms. Such a segregation is completely spontaneous, since no categorization of contents was performed a priori. By exploring the dynamics behind the discussion, we find that users tend to restrict their attention to a specific set of Facebook pages/Twitter accounts. Finally, taking advantage of automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis techniques, we are able to identify the most controversial topics inside and across both platforms. We measure the distance between how a certain topic is presented in the posts/tweets and the related emotional response of users. Our results provide interesting insights for the understanding of the evolution of the core narratives behind different echo chambers and for the early detection of massive viral phenomena around false claims.},

However, a comprehensive analysis of the whole system has been lacking so far, since most studies have focused on the behaviour of one (Bitcoin) or few cryptocurrencies. Here we consider the entire market and analyse the behaviour of {\$}$\backslash$sim{\$} 1,500 cryptocurrencies introduced since April 2013. We reveal that, while new cryptocurrencies appear and disappear continuously and the market share of Bitcoin has been constantly decreasing, several statistical properties of the market have been stable for years. These include the number of active cryptocurrencies, the market share distribution and the turnover of cryptocurrencies. Finally, we adopt an ecological perspective and show that the so-called 'neutral model' of evolution, despite its simplicity, reproduces a number of key empirical observations. We anticipate that our results will be of interest to researchers interested in the study and modelling of the structural properties of the cryptocurrency market.},

The order parameter grows in discrete macroscopic steps with positions that can be randomly distributed even in the thermodynamic limit. These transition positions are, however, correlated and follow scaling laws which arise from discrete scale invariance (DSI) and non self-averaging, both traditionally unrelated to percolation. We reveal the DSI in ensemble measurements of these non self-averaging systems by rescaling of the individual realizations before averaging.},

abstract = {This survey attempts to provide a comprehensive and structured overview of the existing research for the problem of detecting anomalies in discrete/symbolic sequences. The objective is to provide a global understanding of the sequence anomaly detection problem and how existing techniques relate to each other. The key contribution of this survey is the classification of the existing research into three distinct categories, based on the problem formulation that they are trying to solve. These problem formulations are: 1) identifying anomalous sequences with respect to a database of normal sequences; 2) identifying an anomalous subsequence within a long sequence; and 3) identifying a pattern in a sequence whose frequency of occurrence is anomalous. We show how each of these problem formulations is characteristically distinct from each other and discuss their relevance in various application domains. We review techniques from many disparate and disconnected application domains that address each of these formulations. Within each problem formulation, we group techniques into categories based on the nature of the underlying algorithm. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and show how the existing techniques are variants of the basic technique. This approach shows how different techniques within a category are related or different from each other. Our categorization reveals new variants and combinations that have not been investigated before for anomaly detection. We also provide a discussion of relative strengths and weaknesses of different techniques. We show how techniques developed for one problem formulation can be adapted to solve a different formulation, thereby providing several novel adaptations to solve the different problem formulations. We also highlight the applicability of the techniques that handle discrete sequences to other related areas such as online anomaly detection and time series anomaly detection. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Although each of these threats has its own characteristics, its underlying network determines the spreading. To restrain the spreading, a widely used approach is the fragmentation of these networks through immunization, so that epidemics cannot spread. Here we develop an immunization approach based on optimizing the susceptible size, which outperforms the best known strategy based on immunizing the highest-betweenness links or nodes. We find that the network's vulnerability can be significantly reduced, demonstrating this on three different real networks: the global flight network, a school friendship network, and the internet. In all cases, we find that not only is the average infection probability significantly suppressed, but also for the most relevant case of a small and limited number of immunization units the infection probability can be reduced by up to 55{\%}.},

abstract = {Clustering is one of the most universal approaches for understanding complex data. A pivotal aspect of clustering analysis is quantitatively comparing clusterings; clustering comparison is the basis for many tasks such as clustering evaluation, consensus clustering, and tracking the temporal evolution of clusters. In particular, the extrinsic evaluation of clustering methods requires comparing the uncovered clusterings to planted clusterings or known metadata. Yet, as we demonstrate, existing clustering comparison measures have critical biases which undermine their usefulness, and no measure accommodates both overlapping and hierarchical clusterings. Here we unify the comparison of disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchically structured clusterings by proposing a new element-centric framework: elements are compared based on the relationships induced by the cluster structure, as opposed to the traditional cluster-centric philosophy. We demonstrate that, in contrast to standard clustering similarity measures, our framework does not suffer from critical biases and naturally provides unique insights into how the clusterings differ. We illustrate the strengths of our framework by revealing new insights into the organization of clusters in two applications: the improved classification of schizophrenia based on the overlapping and hierarchical community structure of fMRI brain networks, and the disentanglement of various social homophily factors in Facebook social networks. The universality of clustering suggests far-reaching impact of our framework throughout all areas of science.},

abstract = {Simplicial complexes are increasingly used to understand the topology of complex systems as different as brain networks and social interactions. It is therefore of special interest to extend the study of percolation to simplicial complexes. Here we propose a topological theory of percolation for discrete hyperbolic simplicial complexes. Specifically we consider hyperbolic manifolds in dimension {\$}d=2{\$} and {\$}d=3{\$} formed by simplicial complexes, and we investigate their percolation properties in the presence of topological damage, i.e., when nodes, links, triangles or tetrahedra are randomly removed. We reveal that in {\$}d=2{\$} simplicial complexes there are four topological percolation problems and in {\$}d=3{\$}, six. We demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of two percolation phase transitions characteristic of hyperbolic spaces for the different variants of topological percolation. While most of the known results on percolation in hyperbolic manifolds are in {\$}d=2{\$}, here we uncover the rich critical behavior of {\$}d=3{\$} hyperbolic manifolds, and show that triangle percolation displays a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. Finally we show evidence that topological percolation can display a critical behavior that is unexpected if only node and link percolation are considered.},

In this paper, we define a heterogeneity index 0 ≤ H {\textless} 1 to quantify the degree heterogeneity of any given network. We analytically show the existence of an upper bound of H = 0.5 for exponential networks, thus explain why exponential networks are homogeneous. On the other hand, we also analytically show that the heterogeneity index of an infinite power law network is between 1 and 0.5 if and only if its degree exponent is between 2 and 2.5. We further show that for any power law network with a degree exponent greater than 2.5, there always exists an exponential network such that both networks have the same heterogeneity index. This may help to explain why 2.5 is a critical degree exponent for some dynamic behaviors on power law networks. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

One useful approach is investigating localization properties of eigenvectors having diverse applications including disease-spreading phenomena in underlying networks. In this work, we evolve an initial random network with an edge rewiring optimization technique considering the inverse participation ratio as a fitness function. The evolution process yields a network having localized principal eigenvector. We analyze various properties of the optimized networks and those obtained at the intermediate stage. Our investigations reveal the existence of few special structural features of such optimized networks including the presence of a set of edges which are necessary for the localization, and rewiring only one of them leads to a complete delocalization of the principal eigenvector. Our investigation reveals that PEV localization is not a consequence of a single network property, and preferably requires co-existence of various distinct structural as well as spectral features.},

abstract = {In real networks complex topological features are often associated with a diversity of interactions as measured by the weights of the links. Moreover, spatial constraints may as well play an important role, resulting in a complex interplay between topology, weight, and geography. In order to study the vulnerability of such networks to intentional attacks, these attributes must be therefore considered along with the topological quantities. In order to tackle this issue, we consider the case of the world-wide airport network, which is a weighted heterogeneous network whose evolution and structure are influenced by traffic and geographical constraints. We first characterize relevant topological and weighted centrality measures and then use these quantities as selection criteria for the removal of vertices. We consider different attack strategies and different measures of the damage achieved in the network. The analysis of weighted properties shows that centrality driven attacks are capable to shatter the network's communication or transport properties even at very low level of damage in the connectivity pattern. The inclusion of weight and traffic therefore provides evidence for the extreme vulnerability of complex networks to any targeted strategy and need to be considered as key features in the finding and development of defensive strategies.},

abstract = {Novelties are a familiar part of daily life. They are also fundamental to the evolution of biological systems, human society, and technology. By opening new possibilities, one novelty can pave the way for others in a process that Kauffman has called “expanding the adjacent possible”. The dynamics of correlated novelties, however, have yet to be quantified empirically or modeled mathematically. Here we propose a simple mathematical model that mimics the process of exploring a physical, biological, or conceptual space that enlarges whenever a novelty occurs. The model, a generalization of Polya's urn, predicts statistical laws for the rate at which novelties happen (Heaps' law) and for the probability distribution on the space explored (Zipf's law), as well as signatures of the process by which one novelty sets the stage for another. We test these predictions on four data sets of human activity: the edit events of Wikipedia pages, the emergence of tags in annotation systems, the sequence of words in texts, and listening to new songs in online music catalogues. By quantifying the dynamics of correlated novelties, our results provide a starting point for a deeper understanding of the adjacent possible and its role in biological, cultural, and technological evolution.},

They appear in various contexts such as sociology, biology, etc., and they generally contain highly connected subgroups called communities. Community detection is a well-studied problem and most of the algorithms aim to maximize the Newman-Girvan modularity function, the most popular being the Louvain method (it is well-suited on very large graphs). However, the classical modularity has many drawbacks: we can find partitions of high quality in graphs without community structure, e.g., on random graphs; it promotes large communities. Then, we have adapted the Louvain method to other quality functions. In this paper, we describe a generic version of the Louvain method. In particular, we give a sufficient condition to plug a quality function into it. We also show that global performance of this new version is similar to the classical Louvain algorithm, that promotes it to the best rank of the community detection algorithms.},

abstract = {We address here the problem of generating random graphs uniformly from the set of simple connected graphs having a prescribed degree sequence. Our goal is to provide an algorithm designed for practical use both because of its ability to generate very large graphs (efficiency) and because it is easy to implement (simplicity). We focus on a family of heuristics for which we prove optimality conditions, and show how this optimality can be reached in practice. We then propose a different approach, specifically designed for typical real-world degree distributions, which outperforms the first one. Assuming a conjecture, we finally obtain an O(n log n) algorithm, which, in spite of being very simple, improves the best known complexity.},

@article{Kehagias2013,
abstract = {In this paper we discuss some problematic aspects of Newman's modularity function QN. Given a graph G, the modularity of G can be written as QN = Qf Q0, where Qf is the intracluster edge fraction of G and Q0 is the expected intracluster edge fraction of the null model, i.e., a randomly connected graph with same expected degree distribution as G. It follows that the maximization of QN must accomodate two factors pulling in opposite directions: Qf favors a small number of clusters and Q0 favors many balanced (i.e., with ap- proximately equal degrees) clusters. In certain cases the Q0 term can cause overestimation of the true cluster number; this is the opposite of the well-known underestimation e{\_}ect caused by the $\backslash$resolution limit" of modularity. We illustrate the overestimation e{\_}ect by constructing families of graphs with a $\backslash$natural" community structure which, however, does not maximize modularity. In fact, we prove that we can always {\_}nd a graph G with a $\backslash$natural clustering" V of G and another, balanced clustering U of G such that (i) the pair (G;U) has higher modularity than (G;V) and (ii) V and U are arbitrarily di{\_}erent..},

abstract = {Here we present a range-limited approach to centrality measures in both nonweighted and weighted directed complex networks. We introduce an efficient method that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality based on shortest paths of lengths not longer than =1,...,L in the case of nonweighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities based on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than w=$\Delta$, =1,2...,L=R/$\Delta$. These measures provide a systematic description on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its network neighborhoods one step out, two steps out, etc., up to and including the whole network. They are more informative than traditional centrality measures, as network transport typically happens on all length scales, from transport to nearest neighbors to the farthest reaches of the network. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws for large nonweighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality measures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently estimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the traditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the ranking top list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities quickly freezes as a function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top list can be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest node-to-node distance for a network of N nodes, exploiting the afore-mentioned scaling behavior. These observations were made on model networks and on a large social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs (∼5.5×106 nodes and ∼2.7×107 edges). Finally, we apply these concepts to efficiently detect the vulnerability backbone of a network (defined as the smallest percolating cluster of the highest betweenness nodes and edges) and illustrate the importance of weight-based centrality measures in weighted networks in detecting such backbones. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {For many networks of scientific interest we know both the connections of the network and information about the network nodes, such as the age or gender of individuals in a social network, geographic location of nodes in the Internet, or cellular function of nodes in a gene regulatory network. Here we demonstrate how this "metadata" can be used to improve our analysis and understanding of network structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detection in networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that combines a network and its metadata to detect communities more accurately than can be done with either alone. Crucially, the method does not assume that the metadata are correlated with the communities we are trying to find. Instead the method learns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether they contain useful information. The learned correlations are also of interest in their own right, allowing us to make predictions about the community membership of nodes whose network connections are unknown. We demonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure and on real-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological, and technological domains.},

@article{Fan2019,
abstract = {Betweenness centrality (BC) is one of the most used centrality measures for network analysis, which seeks to describe the importance of nodes in a network in terms of the fraction of shortest paths that pass through them. It is key to many valuable applications, including community detection and network dismantling. Computing BC scores on large networks is computationally challenging due to high time complexity. Many approximation algorithms have been proposed to speed up the estimation of BC, which are mainly sampling-based. However, these methods are still prone to considerable execution time on large-scale networks, and their results are often exacerbated when small changes happen to the network structures. In this paper, we focus on identifying nodes with high BC in a graph, since many application scenarios are built upon retrieving nodes with top-k BC. Different from previous heuristic methods, we turn this task into a learning problem and design an encoder-decoder based framework to resolve the problem. More specifcally, the encoder leverages the network structure to encode each node into an embedding vector, which captures the important structural information of the node. The decoder transforms the embedding vector for each node into a scalar, which captures the relative rank of this node in terms of BC. We use the pairwise ranking loss to train the model to identify the orders of nodes regarding their BC. By training on small-scale networks, the learned model is capable of assigning relative BC scores to nodes for any unseen networks, and thus identifying the highly-ranked nodes. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that, compared to representative baselines, our model drastically speeds up the prediction without noticeable sacrifce in accuracy, and outperforms the state-of-the-art by accuracy on several large real-world networks.},

Real-world networks for the former are the protein-interaction networks, the metabolic networks for eukaryotes and bacteria, and the coauthorship network, and those for the latter one are the Internet, the World Wide Web, and the metabolic networks for Archaea. Distinct features of the mass-distance relation, generic topology of geodesics, and resilience under attack of the two classes are identified. Various model networks also belong to either of the two classes, while their degree exponents are tunable.},

abstract = {The problem of finding a better immunization strategy for controlling the spreading of the epidemic with limited resources has attracted much attention because of its great theoretical significance and wide application. In this paper, we propose a successful immunization strategy only depending on local information. Our strategy initializes the scores of nodes with the values of their degree and recalculates the score of a certain immunized node based on its local information, and then replaces the certain immunized node with its nonimmunized higher-score neighbor. To test the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we conduct the experiments on several synthetic networks and real-world networks. The results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the existing well-known local strategies, even the degree centrality targeted strategy.},

The importance of spatial networks in real-world applications makes these transitions very relevant, and this review is meant as a step towards a deeper understanding of the effect of space on network structures.},

abstract = {Some aspects of real-world road networks seem to have an approximate scale invariance property, motivating study of mathematical models of random networks whose distributions are exactly invariant under Euclidean scaling. This requires working in the continuum plane, so making a precise definition is not trivial. We introduce an axiomatization of a class of processes we call scaleinvariant random spatial networks, whose primitives are routes between each pair of points in the plane. One concrete model, based on minimum-time routes in a binary hierarchy of roads with different speed limits, has been shown to satisfy the axioms, and two other constructions (based on Poisson line processes and on dynamic proximity graphs) are expected also to do so. We initiate study of structure theory and summary statistics for general processes in the class. Many questions arise in this setting via analogies with diverse existing topics, from geodesics in first-passage percolation to transit node-based route-finding algorithms.},

As the human driver recognises travel-times rather than distances, faster roads appear to be 'shorter' than slower ones. The resulting metric space has an effective dimension $\delta${\textgreater}2, which is a significant measure of the heterogeneity of road speeds. We found that traffic strongly concentrates on only a small fraction of the roads. The distribution of vehicular flows over the roads obeys a power law, indicating a clear hierarchical order of the roads.

Such a balance could be established and maintained in an experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical circuitry.},

abstract = {Symmetries in physical theories denote invariance under some transformation, such as self-similarity under a change of scale. The renormalization group provides a powerful framework to study these symmetries, leading to a better understanding of the universal properties of phase transitions. However, the small-world property of complex networks complicates application of the renormalization group by introducing correlations between coexisting scales. Here, we provide a framework for the investigation of complex networks at different resolutions. The approach is based on geometric representations, which have been shown to sustain network navigability and to reveal the mechanisms that govern network structure and evolution. We define a geometric renormalization group for networks by embedding them into an underlying hidden metric space. We find that real scale-free networks show geometric scaling under this renormalization group transformation. We unfold the networks in a selfsimilar multilayer shell that distinguishes the coexisting scales and their interactions. This in turn offers a basis for exploring critical phenomena and universality in complex networks. It also affords us immediate practical applications, including highfidelity smaller-scale replicas of large networks and a multiscale navigation protocol in hyperbolic space, which betters those on single layers.},

We show that the following two ingredients are essential for obtaining an abrupt (first-order) transition in the fraction of the system occupied by the largest cluster: (i) the size of all growing clusters should be kept approximately the same, and (ii) the inclusion of merging bonds (i.e., bonds connecting vertices in different clusters) should dominate with respect to the redundant bonds (i.e., bonds connecting vertices in the same cluster). Moreover, in the extreme limit where only merging bonds are present, a complete enumeration scheme based on tree-like graphs can be used to obtain an exact solution of our model that displays a first-order transition. Finally, the proposed mechanism can be viewed as a generalization of standard percolation that discloses an entirely new family of models with potential application in growth and fragmentation processes of real network systems.},

Here, we study the behaviour of the basic reaction–diffusion process (given by the reaction steps BA and B+A2B) defined on networks with heterogeneous topology and no limit on the nodes' occupation number. We investigate the effect of network topology on the basic properties of the system's phase diagram and find that the network heterogeneity sustains the reaction activity even in the limit of a vanishing density of particles, eventually suppressing the critical point in density-driven phase transitions, whereas phase transition and critical points independent of the particle density are not altered by topological fluctuations. This work lays out a theoretical and computational microscopic framework for the study of a wide range of realistic metapopulation and agent-based models that include the complex features of real-world networks.},

abstract = {Many complex systems can be described by networks, in which the constituent components are represented by vertices and the connections between the components are represented by edges between the corresponding vertices. A fundamental issue concerning complex networked systems is the robustness of the overall system to the failure of its constituent parts. Since the degree to which a networked system continues to function, as its component parts are degraded, typically depends on the integrity of the underlying network, the question of system robustness can be addressed by analyzing how the network structure changes as vertices are removed. Previous work has considered how the structure of complex networks change as vertices are removed uniformly at random, in decreasing order of their degree, or in decreasing order of their betweenness centrality. Here we extend these studies by investigating the effect on network structure of targeting vertices for removal based on a wider range of non-local measures of potential importance than simply degree or betweenness. We consider the effect of such targeted vertex removal on model networks with different degree distributions, clustering coefficients and assortativity coefficients, and for a variety of empirical networks.},

abstract = {We analyze a minimal model of a growing network. At each time step, a new vertex is added; then, with probability delta, two vertices are chosen uniformly at random and joined by an undirected edge. This process is repeated for t time steps. In the limit of large t, the resulting graph displays surprisingly rich characteristics. In particular, a giant component emerges in an infinite-order phase transition at delta = 1/8. At the transition, the average component size jumps discontinuously but remains finite. In contrast, a static random graph with the same degree distribution exhibits a second-order phase transition at delta = 1/4, and the average component size diverges there. These dramatic differences between grown and static random graphs stem from a positive correlation between the degrees of connected vertices in the grown graph--older vertices tend to have higher degree, and to link with other high-degree vertices, merely by virtue of their age. We conclude that grown graphs, however randomly they are constructed, are fundamentally different from their static random graph counterparts.},

abstract = {The analysis of real-world systems through the lens of complex networks often requires a node importance function. While many such views on importance exist, a frequently used global node importance measure is betweenness centrality, quantifying the number of times a node occurs on all shortest paths in a network. This centrality of nodes often significantly depends on the presence of nodes in the network; once a node is missing, e.g., due to a failure, other nodes' centrality values can change dramatically. This observation is, for instance, important when dismantling a network: instead of removing the nodes in decreasing order of their static betweenness, recomputing the betweenness after a removal creates tremendously stronger attacks, as has been shown in recent research. This process is referred to as interactive betweenness centrality. Nevertheless, very few studies compute the interactive betweenness centrality, given its high computational costs, a worst-case runtime complexity of O(N∗∗4) in the number of nodes in the network. In this study, we address the research questions, whether approximations of interactive betweenness centrality can be obtained with reduction of computational costs and how much quality/accuracy needs to be traded in order to obtain a significant reduction. At the heart of our interactive betweenness approximation framework, we use a set of established betweenness approximation techniques, which come with a wide range of parameter settings. Given that we are interested in the top-ranked node(s) for interactive dismantling, we tune these methods accordingly. Moreover, we explore the idea of batch removal, where groups of top-k ranked nodes are removed before recomputation of betweenness centrality values. Our experiments on real-world and random networks show that specific variants of the approximate interactive betweenness framework allow for a speedup of two orders of magnitude, compared to the exact computation, while obtaining near-optimal results. This work contributes to the analysis of complex network phenomena, with a particular focus on obtaining scalable techniques.},

Both algorithms employ the same tree-based graph representation and so, in concert, can arbitrarily modify any graph. Since the clusters of a percolation model may be described as simple connected graphs, an efficient Monte Carlo scheme can be constructed which uses the algorithms to sweep the occupation probability back and forth between two turning points. This approach concentrates computational sampling time within a region of interest. A high-precision value of pc =0.592 746 03 (9) was thus obtained, by Mersenne twister, for the two-dimensional square site percolation threshold. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

We have observed two universality classes with eta approximately equal 2.2(1) and 2.0, respectively. Real-world networks for the former are the protein-interaction networks, the metabolic networks for eukaryotes and bacteria, and the coauthorship network, and those for the latter one are the Internet, the World Wide Web, and the metabolic networks for Archaea. Distinct features of the mass-distance relation, generic topology of geodesics, and resilience under attack of the two classes are identified. Various model networks also belong to either of the two classes, while their degree exponents are tunable.},

Instead they form components of larger systems in which multiple networks with distinct topologies coexist and where elements distributed amongst different networks may interact directly. Here we develop a mathematical framework based on generating functions for analyzing a system of L interacting networks given the connectivity within and between networks. We derive exact expressions for the percolation threshold describing the onset of large-scale connectivity in the system of networks and each network individually. These general expressions apply to networks with arbitrary degree distributions and we explicitly evaluate them for L=2 interacting networks with a few choices of degree distributions. We show that the percolation threshold in an individual network can be significantly lowered once "hidden" connections to other networks are considered. We show applications of the framework to two real-world systems involving communications networks and socio-tecnical congruence in software systems.},

Using the renormalization-group-like procedure, we derive the recursion relations for the percolating probability and the percolation order parameter, from which the percolation threshold and the critical exponents are obtained. When u not equal 1, the DOP critical behavior turns out to be identical to that of the bond percolation with a shifted nonzero percolation threshold. When u = 1, the DOP and the bond percolation have the same vanishing percolation threshold but the critical behaviors are different. Implication to an epidemic spreading phenomenon is discussed.},

abstract = {Stochastic blockmodels have been proposed as a tool for detecting community structure in networks as well as for generating synthetic networks for use as benchmarks. Most blockmodels, however, ignore variation in vertex degree, making them unsuitable for applications to real-world networks, which typically display broad degree distributions that can significantly distort the results. Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for community detection using this objective function or its non-degree-corrected counterpart and show that the degree-corrected version dramatically outperforms the uncorrected one in both real-world and synthetic networks.},

Accordingly, with the rise of network science for modeling complex systems, many methods for robustness estimation and network dismantling have been developed and applied to real-world problems. The state-of-the-art in this field is quite fuzzy, as results are published in various domain-specific venues and using different datasets. In this study, we report, to the best of our knowledge, on the analysis of the largest benchmark regarding network dismantling. We reimplemented and compared 13 competitors on 12 types of random networks, including ER, BA, and WS, with different network generation parameters. We find that network metrics, proposed more than 20 years ago, are often non-dominating competitors, while many recently proposed techniques perform well only on specific network types. Besides the solution quality, we also investigate the execution time. Moreover, we analyze the similarity of competitors, as induced by their node rankings. We compare and validate our results on real-world networks. Our study is aimed to be a reference for selecting a network dismantling method for a given network, considering accuracy requirements and run time constraints.},

Here we review explosive percolation, the sudden emergence of large-scale connectivity that results fromrepeated, small interventions designed to delay the percolation transition.These transitions exhibit drastic, unanticipated and exciting consequences that make explosive percolation an emerging paradigm for modelling real-world systems ranging from social networks to nanotubes.},

The results are in agreement with numerical simulations for a broad range of network sizes and connectivities. The average and standard deviation of the distribution are also obtained. In the case in which the mean degree scales as N$\alpha$ with the network size, the distribution becomes extremely narrow in the asymptotic limit, namely almost all pairs of nodes are equidistant, at distance d = [1/$\alpha$] from each other. The distribution of shortest path lengths between nodes of degree m and the rest of the network is calculated. Its average is shown to be a monotonically decreasing function of m, providing an interesting relation between a local property and a global property of the network. The methodology presented here can be applied to more general classes of networks.},

abstract = {To investigate the statistical behavior in the sizes of finite clusters for percolation, cluster size distribution n s (p) for site and bond percolations at different lattices and dimensions was simulated using a modified algorithm. An equation to approximate the finite cluster size distribution n s (p) was obtained and expressed as: log∈(n s (p)) = as - b log∈s + c. Based on the analysis of simulation data, we found that the equation is valid for p from 0 to 1 on site and for the bond percolation of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) lattices. Furthermore, the relationship between the coefficients of the equation and the occupied ratio p was studied using the finite-size scaling method. When x = D(p p c)Lyt, p {\textless} p c, and D was a nonuniversal metric factor. a was found to be related only to p, and the a-x curves of different lattices were nearly overlapped; b was related to the dimensions and p, and the scaled data of the b of all lattices with the same dimension tended to fall on the same curves. Unlike a and b, c apparently had a quadratic relation with x in 2D lattices and linear relation with x in 3D lattices. The results of this paper could significantly reduce the amount of tasks required to obtain numerical data of on the cluster size distribution for p from 0 to p c . {\textcopyright} 2014 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Many networks, indifferent of their function and scope, converge to a scale-free architecture in which the degree distribution approximately follows a power law. Meanwhile, many of those scale-free networks are found to be naturally divided into communities of densely connected nodes, known as community structure. Finding this community structure is a fundamental but challenging topic in network science. Since Newman's suggestion of using modularity as a measure to qualify the strength of community structure, many efficient methods that find community structure based on maximizing modularity have been proposed. However, there is a lack of approximation algorithms that provide provable quality bounds for the problem. In this paper, we propose polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the modularity maximization problem together with their theoretical justifications in the context of scale-free networks. We prove that the solutions of the proposed algorithms, even in the worst-case, are optimal up to a constant factor for scale-free networks with either bidirectional or unidirectional links. Even though our focus in this work is not on designing another empirically good algorithms to detect community structure, experiments on real-world networks suggest that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art modularity maximization algorithm.},

abstract = {We study the site percolation under Achlioptas process with a product rule in a two-dimensional square lattice. From the measurement of the cluster size distribution Ps, we find that Ps has a very robust power-law regime followed by a stable hump near the transition threshold. Based on the careful analysis on the Ps distribution, we show that the transition should be discontinuous. The existence of the hysteresis loop in order parameter also verifies that the transition is discontinuous in two dimensions. Moreover, we also show that the transition nature from the product rule is not the same as that from a sum rule in two dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Complex biological, technological, and sociological networks can be of very different sizes and connectivities, making it difficult to compare their structures. Here we present an approach to systematically study similarity in the local structure of networks, based on the significance profile (SP) of small subgraphs in the network compared to randomized networks. We find several superfamilies of previously unrelated networks with very similar SPs. One superfamily, including transcription networks of microorganisms, represents "rate-limited" information-processing networks strongly constrained by the response time of their components. A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages.},

In many real-world scenarios, however, attacks are neither random nor hub-targeted, but localized, where a group of neighboring nodes in a network are attacked and fail. In this paper we develop a percolation framework to analytically and numerically study the robustness of complex networks against such localized attack. In particular, we investigate this robustness in Erds-R{\'{e}}nyi networks, random-regular networks, and scale-free networks. Our results provide insight into how to better protect networks, enhance cybersecurity, and facilitate the design of more robust infrastructures.},

abstract = {Understanding the resilience of infrastructures such as transportation network has significant importance for our daily life. Recently, a homogeneous spatial network model was developed for studying spatial embedded networks with characteristic link length such as power-grids and the brain. However, although many real-world networks are spatially embedded and their links have characteristics length such as pipelines, power lines or ground transportation lines they are not homogeneous but rather heterogeneous. For example, density of links within cities are significantly higher than between cities. Here we present and study numerically and analytically a similar realistic heterogeneous spatial modular model using percolation process to better understand the effect of heterogeneity on such networks. The model assumes that inside a city there are many lines connecting different locations, while long lines between the cities are sparse and usually directly connecting only a few nearest neighbours cities in a two dimensional plane. We find that this model experiences two distinct continues transitions, one when the cities disconnect from each other and the second when each city breaks apart. Although the critical threshold for site percolation in 2D grid remains an open question we analytically find the critical threshold for site percolation in this model. In addition, while the homogeneous model experience a single transition having a unique phenomenon called $\backslash$textit{\{}critical stretching{\}} where a geometric crossover from random to spatial structure in different scales found to stretch non-linearly with the characteristic length at criticality. Here we show that the heterogeneous model do not experience such a phenomenon indicating that critical stretching strongly depends on the network structure.},

For the particular case of the power-law degree distribution, we show that the component size distribution itself follows a power law everywhere below the phase transition at which a giant component forms, but takes an exponential form when a giant component is present.},

abstract = {Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed update algorithm substantially reduces the number of shortest paths which should be re-computed when a graph is changed. In addition, we adapt a community detection algorithm using the proposed algorithm to show how much benefit can be obtained from the proposed algorithm in a practical application. Experimental results on real graphs show that the proposed algorithm efficiently update betweenness centrality and detect communities in a graph.},

After years of doctrinal stasis and practical anonymity, federal agencies began asserting the theory more aggressively after 9/11, thereby testing the limits of executive secrecy and of judicial deference. Though essentially valid, the mosaic theory has been applied in ways that are unfalsifiable, in tension with the text and purpose of FOIA, and susceptible to abuse and overbreadth. This Note therefore argues, against precedent, for greater judicial scrutiny of mosaic theory claims.},

@article{Radicchi2008,
abstract = {Recently, it has been claimed that some complex networks are self-similar under a convenient renormalization procedure. We present a general method to study renormalization flows in graphs. We find that the behavior of some variables under renormalization, such as the maximum number of connections of a node, obeys simple scaling laws, characterized by critical exponents. This is true for any class of graphs, from random to scale-free networks, from lattices to hierarchical graphs. Therefore, renormalization flows for graphs are similar as in the renormalization of spin systems. An analysis of classic renormalization for percolation and the Ising model on the lattice confirms this analogy. Critical exponents and scaling functions can be used to classify graphs in universality classes, and to uncover similarities between graphs that are inaccessible to a standard analysis.},

abstract = {Interventions of central, top-down planning are serious limitations to the possibility of modelling the dynamics of cities. An example is the city of Paris (France), which during the 19th century experienced large modifications supervised by a central authority, the 'Haussmann period'. In this article, we report an empirical analysis of more than 200 years (1789-2010) of the evolution of the street network of Paris. We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales.},

Links between nodes are introduced in order to produce a scale-free graph with given exponent lambda for the degree distribution, but the choice of each new link depends on the mass of the clusters that this link will merge. Networks constructed via this biased procedure show a percolation transition which strongly differs from the one observed in standard percolation, where links are introduced just randomly. The different growth process leads to a phase transition with a nonvanishing percolation threshold already for lambda{\textgreater}lambda(c) approximately 2.2. More interestingly, the transition is continuous when lambda{\textless}or=3 but becomes discontinuous when lambda{\textgreater}3. This may have important consequences for both the structure of networks and for the dynamics of processes taking place on them.},

To address topological properties of these two networks, we quantified correlations between connectivities of interacting nodes and compared them to a null model of a network, in which all links were randomly rewired. We found that for both interaction and regulatory networks, links between highly connected proteins are systematically suppressed, whereas those between a highly connected and low-connected pairs of proteins are favored. This effect decreases the likelihood of cross talk between different functional modules of the cell and increases the overall robustness of a network by localizing effects of deleterious perturbations.},

abstract = {Detecting community structure is fundamental for uncovering the links between structure and function in complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology. A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.},

Then, we carry on comparing synchronization time for several other topological configurations, characterized by a different degree of randomness. The analysis shows that regular lattices perform better than any other disordered network. The fact can be understood by considering the variability in the number of links between two adjacent neighbors. This phenomenon is equivalent to have a non-random topology with a distribution of interactions and it can be removed by an adequate local normalization of the couplings.},

Like other local and meso-scale structure of networks, communities are generally heterogeneous in various aspects such as the size, density of edges, connectivity to other communities and significance. In the present study, we propose a method to statistically test the significance of individual communities in a given network. Compared to the previous methods, the present algorithm is unique in that it accepts different community-detection algorithms and the corresponding quality function for single communities. The present method requires that a quality of each community can be quantified and that community detection is performed as optimisation of such a quality function summed over the communities. Various community detection algorithms including modularity maximisation and graph partitioning meet this criterion. Our method estimates a distribution of the quality function for randomised networks to calculate a likelihood of each community in the given network. We illustrate our algorithm by synthetic and empirical networks.},

abstract = {We show that renormalization group (RG) theory applied to complex networks are useful to classify network topologies into universality classes in the space of configurations. The RG flow readily identifies a small-world/fractal transition by finding (i) a trivial stable fixed point of a complete graph, (ii) a non-trivial point of a pure fractal topology that is stable or unstable according to the amount of long-range links in the network, and (iii) another stable point of a fractal with short-cuts that exists exactly at the small-world/fractal transition. As a collateral, the RG technique explains the coexistence of the seemingly contradicting fractal and small-world phases and allows to extract information on the distribution of short-cuts in real-world networks, a problem of importance for information flow in the system.},

Load, or "betweenness centrality," of a vertex is the accumulated total number of data packets passing through that vertex when every pair of vertices sends and receives a data packet along the shortest path connecting the pair. It is found that the load distribution follows a power law with the exponent delta approximately 2.2(1), insensitive to different values of gamma in the range, 2 {\textless} gamma {\textless} or = 3, and different mean degrees, which is valid for both undirected and directed cases.

abstract = {The whole frame of interconnections in complex networks hinges on a specific set of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated, would cause the spread of information to the whole network [1]; or, if immunized, would prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic [2,3]. Localizing this optimal, i.e. minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science [4,5]. Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders [6-14], the problem remains unsolved. Here, we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix [15] of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly-connected nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. Eventually, the present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous transition from a known phase [16].},

@article{Ramirez2019,
abstract = {Numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been carried out to study the problem of inverse site percolation by the removal of {\$}k \backslashtimes k{\$} square tiles ({\$}k{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}-mers) from square lattices. The process starts with an initial configuration, where all lattice sites are occupied and, obviously, the opposite sides of the lattice are connected by occupied sites. Then, the system is diluted by removing {\$}k{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}-mers of occupied sites from the lattice following a random sequential adsorption mechanism. The process finishes when the jamming state is reached and no more objects can be removed due to the absence of occupied sites clusters of appropriate size and shape. The central idea of this paper is based on finding the maximum concentration of occupied sites, {\$}p{\_}{\{}c,k{\}}{\$}, for which the connectivity disappears. This particular value of the concentration is called $\backslash$textit{\{}inverse percolation threshold{\}}, and determines a well-defined geometrical phase transition in the system. The results obtained for {\$}p{\_}{\{}c,k{\}}{\$} show that the inverse percolation threshold is a decreasing function of {\$}k{\$} in the range {\$}1 \backslashleq k \backslashleq 4{\$}. For {\$}k \backslashgeq 5{\$}, all jammed configurations are percolating states, and consequently, there is no non-percolating phase. In other words, the lattice remains connected even when the highest allowed concentration of removed sites is reached. The jamming exponent {\$}\backslashnu{\_}j{\$} was measured, being {\$}\backslashnu{\_}j = 1{\$} regardless of the size {\$}k{\$} considered. In addition, the accurate determination of the critical exponents {\$}\backslashnu{\$}, {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} reveals that the percolation phase transition involved in the system, which occurs for {\$}k{\$} varying between 1 and 4, has the same universality class as the standard percolation problem.},

The rules for this site percolation model are physical and very simple, requiring only the introduction of a weight {\$}W(n)=n+1{\$} for a cluster of size {\$}n{\$}. This establishes that a discontinuous percolation transition can occur with qualitatively more local interactions than in all currently considered examples of explosive percolation; and that, unlike these, it can be reversible.

A key concept is introduced, the edge multiplicity, that measures the number of triangles passing through an edge. This quantity extends the clustering coefficient in that it involves the properties of two --and not just one-- vertices. The formalism is completed with the definition of a three-vertex correlation function, which is the fundamental quantity describing the properties of clustered networks. The formalism suggests new metrics that are able to thoroughly characterize transitive relations. A rigorous analysis of several real networks, which makes use of the new formalism and the new metrics, is also provided. It is also found that clustered networks can be classified into two main groups: the {\{}$\backslash$it weak{\}} and the {\{}$\backslash$it strong transitivity{\}} classes. In the first class, edge multiplicity is small, with triangles being disjoint. In the second class, edge multiplicity is high and so triangles share many edges. As we shall see in the following paper, the class a network belongs to has strong implications in its percolation properties.},

The model is characterized by a priority distribution as an input parameter, which describes the choice procedure from the list. We give exact results on the asymptotic behaviour of the model and we show that the interevent time distribution is power-law decaying for any kind of input distributions that remain normalizable in the infinite list limit, with exponents tunable between 1 and 2. The model satisfies a scaling law between the exponents of interevent time distribution ($\beta$) and autocorrelation function ($\alpha$): $\alpha$ + $\beta$ = 2. This law is general for renewal processes with power-law decaying interevent time distribution. We conclude that slowly decaying autocorrelation function indicates long-range dependence only if the scaling law is violated.},

We consider two identical pathways with equal mean input rates, except in one pathway proteins are input one at a time and in the other proteins are input in bursts. Deterministically the dynamics of these two pathways are indistinguishable. However the stochastic behavior falls in three categories: (i) both pathways display or do not display noise-induced oscillations; (ii) the non-bursty input pathway displays noise-induced oscillations whereas the bursty one does not; (iii) the reverse of (ii). We derive necessary conditions for these three cases to classify systems involving autocatalysis, trimerization and genetic feedback loops. Our results suggest that single cell rhythms can be controlled by regulation of burstiness in protein production.},

abstract = {Is the enemy of an enemy necessarily a friend? If not, to what extent does this tend to hold? Such questions were formulated in terms of signed (social) networks and necessary and sufficient conditions for a network to be "balanced" were obtained around 1960. Since then the idea that signed networks tend over time to become more balanced has been widely used in several application areas. However, investigation of this hypothesis has been complicated by the lack of a standard measure of partial balance, since complete balance is almost never achieved in practice. We formalize the concept of a measure of partial balance, discuss various measures, compare the measures on synthetic datasets, and investigate their axiomatic properties. The synthetic data involves Erd$\backslash$H{\{}o{\}}s-R$\backslash$'enyi and specially structured random graphs. We show that some measures behave better than others in terms of axioms and ability to differentiate between graphs. We also use well-known datasets from the sociology and biology literature, such as Read's New Guinean tribes, gene regulatory networks related to two organisms, and a network involving senate bill co-sponsorship. Our results show that substantially different levels of partial balance is observed under cycle-based, eigenvalue-based, and frustration-based measures. We make some recommendations for measures to be used in future work.},

abstract = {Percolation transition is widely observed in networks ranging from biology to engineering. While much attention has been paid to network topologies, studies rarely focus on critical percolation phenomena driven by network dynamics. Using extensive real data, we study the critical percolation properties in city traffic dynamics. Our results suggest that two modes of different critical percolation behaviors are switching in the same network topology under different traffic dynamics. One mode of city traffic (during nonrush hours or days off) has similar critical percolation characteristics as small world networks, while the other mode (during rush hours on working days) tends to behave as a 2D lattice. This switching behavior can be understood by the fact that the high-speed urban roads during nonrush hours or days off (that are congested during rush hours) represent effective long-range connections, like in small world networks. Our results might be useful for understanding and improving traffic resilience.},

abstract = {In a recent work [Schneider et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108, 3838 (2011)], the authors proposed a simple measure for network robustness under malicious attacks on nodes. Using a greedy algorithm, they found that the optimal structure with respect to this quantity is an onion structure in which high-degree nodes form a core surrounded by rings of nodes with decreasing degree. However, in real networks the failure can also occur in links such as dysfunctional power cables and blocked airlines. Accordingly, complementary to the node-robustness measurement (R(n)), we propose a link-robustness index (R(l)). We show that solely enhancing R(n) cannot guarantee the improvement of R(l). Moreover, the structure of an R(l)-optimized network is found to be entirely different from that of an onion network. In order to design robust networks that are resistant to a more realistic attack condition, we propose a hybrid greedy algorithm that takes both the R(n) and R(l) into account. We validate the robustness of our generated networks against malicious attacks mixed with both nodes and links failure. Finally, some economical constraints for swapping the links in real networks are considered, and significant improvement in both aspects of robustness is still achieved.},

Potential edges, sampled uniformly at random from the complete graph, are considered one at a time and either added to the graph or rejected provided that the fraction of accepted edges is never smaller than a decreasing function asymptotically approaching the value $\alpha$=1/2. We show that multiple giant components appear simultaneously in a strongly discontinuous percolation transition and remain distinct. Furthermore, tuning the value of $\alpha$ determines the number of such components with smaller $\alpha$ leading to an increasingly delayed and more explosive transition. The location of the critical point and strongly discontinuous nature are not affected if only edges which span components are sampled.},

abstract = {The onset of large-scale connectivity in a network (i.e., percolation) often has a major impact on the function of the system. Traditionally, graph percolation is analyzed by adding edges to a fixed set of initially isolated nodes. Several years ago, it was shown that adding nodes as well as edges to the graph can yield an infinite order transition, which is much smoother than the traditional second-order transition. More recently, it was shown that adding edges via a competitive process to a fixed set of initially isolated nodes can lead to a delayed, extremely abrupt percolation transition with a significant jump in large but finite systems. Here we analyze a process that combines both node arrival and edge competition. If started from a small collection of seed nodes, we show that the impact of node arrival dominates: although we can significantly delay percolation, the transition is of infinite order. Thus, node arrival can mitigate the trade-off between delay and abruptness that is characteristic of explosive percolation transitions. This realization may inspire new design rules where network growth can temper the effects of delay, creating opportunities for network intervention and control. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Immunization plays an important role in the field of epidemic spreading in complex networks. In previous studies, targeted immunization has been proved to be an effective strategy. However, when extended to networks with community structure, it is unknown whether the superior strategy is to vaccinate the nodes who have the most connections in the entire network (global strategy), or those in the original community where epidemic starts to spread (local strategy). In this work, by using both analytic approaches and simulations, we observe that the answer depends on the closeness between communities. If communities are tied closely, the global strategy is superior to the local strategy. Otherwise, the local targeted immunization is advantageous. The existence of a transitional value of closeness implies that we should adopt different strategies. Furthermore, we extend our investigation from two-community networks to multi-community networks. We consider the mode of community connection and the location of community where epidemic starts to spread. Both simulation results and theoretical predictions show that local strategy is a better option for immunization in most cases. But if the epidemic begins from a core community, global strategy is superior in some cases.},

The first two experiments showed that the social contagion effect persisted when subjects were explicitly warned about the possibility that confederates' responses might induce false memories and when they were tested via source-monitoring tests that explicitly gave the choice of attributing suggested items to the other person. Levels of false recall and recognition increased with the number of times the misleading information was suggested (Experiment 3), and subjects were more likely to incorporate the erroneous responses of an actual confederate on a recognition/source test as compared with those of a simulated confederate (Experiment 4). Collectively, the data support the claim that false memories may be transmitted between people and reveal critical factors that modulate the social contagion of memories.},

The World Airline Network (WAN) is an infrastructure that reduces the geographical gap between societies, both small and large, and brings forth economic gains. With the extensive use of a publicly maintained data set that contains information about airports and alternative connections between these airports, we empirically reveal that the WAN is a redundant and resilient network for long distance air travel, but otherwise breaks down completely due to removal of short and apparently insignificant connections. These short range connections with moderate number of passengers and alternate flights are the connections that keep remote parts of the world accessible. It is surprising, insofar as there exists a highly resilient and strongly connected core consisting of a small fraction of airports (around 2.3{\%}) together with an extremely fragile star-like periphery. Yet, in spite of their relevance, more than 90{\%} of the world airports are still interconnected upon removal of this core. With standard and unconventional removal measures we compare both empirical and topological perceptions for the fragmentation of the world. We identify how the WAN is organized into different classes of clusters based on the physical proximity of airports and analyze the consequence of this fragmentation.},

Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O (md log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m approximately n and d approximately log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O (n log(2) n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2 x 10(6) edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn 2) and space O(n 2) in the worst case, and in time O(n 2log n) and space O(n 2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph).

While configuration model networks are uncorrelated, the giant component exhibits a degree distribution which is different from the overall degree distribution of the network and includes degree-degree correlations of all orders. We present exact analytical results for the degree distributions as well as higher order degree-degree correlations on the giant components of configuration model networks. We show that the degree-degree correlations are essential for the integrity of the giant component, in the sense that the degree distribution alone cannot guarantee that it will consist of a single connected component. To demonstrate the importance and broad applicability of these results, we apply them to the study of the distribution of shortest path lengths on the giant component, percolation on the giant component and the spectra of sparse matrices defined on the giant component. We show that by using the degree distribution on the giant component, one obtains high quality results for these properties, which can be further improved by taking the degree-degree correlations into account. This suggests that many existing methods, currently used for the analysis of the whole network, can be adapted in a straightforward fashion to yield results conditioned on the giant component.},

abstract = {Information cascades are important dynamical processes in complex networks. An information cascade can describe the spreading dynamics of rumour, disease, memes, or marketing campaigns, which initially start from a node or a set of nodes in the network. If conditions are right, information cascades rapidly encompass large parts of the network, thus leading to epidemics or epidemic spreading. Certain network topologies are particularly conducive to epidemics, while others decelerate and even prohibit rapid information spreading. Here we review models that describe information cascades in complex networks, with an emphasis on the role and consequences of node centrality. In particular, we present simulation results on sample networks that reveal just how relevant the centrality of initiator nodes is on the latter development of an information cascade, and we define the spreading influence of a node as the fraction of nodes that is activated as a result of the initial activation of that node. A systemic review of existing results shows that some centrality measures, such as the degree and betweenness, are positively correlated with the spreading influence, while other centrality measures, such as eccentricity and the information index, have negative correlation. A positive correlation implies that choosing a node with the highest centrality value will activate the largest number of nodes, while a negative correlation implies that the node with the lowest centrality value will have the same effect.We discuss possible applications of these results, and we emphasize how information cascades can help us identify nodes with the highest spreading capability in complex networks.},

Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

abstract = {Using finite-size scaling, we have investigated the percolation phase transitions of evolving random networks under a generalized Achlioptas process (GAP). During this GAP, the edge with a minimum product of two connecting cluster sizes is taken with a probability p from two randomly chosen edges. This model becomes the Erd{\"{o}}s-R{\'{e}}nyi network at p=0.5 and the random network under the Achlioptas process at p=1. Using both the fixed point of the size ratio s 2/s 1 and the straight line of lns 1, where s 1 and s 2 are the reduced sizes of the largest and the second-largest cluster, we demonstrate that the phase transitions of this model are continuous for 0.5≤p≤1. From the slopes of lns 1 and ln (s 2/s 1)′ at the critical point, we get critical exponents $\beta$ and $\nu$ of the phase transitions. At 0.5≤p≤0.8, it is found that $\beta$, $\nu$, and s 2/s 1 at critical point are unchanged and the phase transitions belong to the same universality class. When p≥0.9, $\beta$, $\nu$, and s 2/s 1 at critical point vary with p and the universality class of phase transitions depends on p. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

@article{Sarzynska2015,
abstract = {In the study of networks, it is often insightful to use algorithms to determine mesoscale features such as "community structure", in which densely connected sets of nodes constitute "communities" that have sparse connections to other communities. The most popular way of detecting communities algorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When optimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or time-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph ensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes that are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the null model. Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally on the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel null models that take into account appropriate features of the system under study. In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take incorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the radiation model of population spread. We also develop novel synthetic spatial benchmark networks in which the connections between entities are based on distance or flux between nodes, and we compare the performance of both static and time-dependent radiation null models to the standard ("Newman-Girvan") null model for modularity optimization and a recently-proposed gravity null model. In our comparisons, we use both the above synthetic benchmarks and time-dependent correlation networks that we construct using countrywide dengue fever incidence data for Peru. We also evaluate a recently-proposed correlation null model, which was developed specifically for correlation networks that are constructed from time series, on the epidemic-correlation data.},

As part of a wider research project into the potential of practice computer appointment systems as a data source, we wanted to explore the aggregate pattern of default. Method. Comprehensive computer appointment data from nine general practices for 1 or 2 years were analysed to explore the pattern of defaulted appointments for doctors and practice nurses. Results. Around 6.5{\%} of all appointments ended in a default. Default rates were found to be highest amongst young adults and, at a practice level, to be highly correlated with deprivation level. About two-thirds of those who defaulted only did it once during the year. A small core of patients defaulted frequently, but only a quarter of these repeated their behaviour in the following year. Conclusions. The discussion suggests that strategies based on educating or punishing defaulters in order to change their behaviour may be of limited effectiveness.},

abstract = {Amultiagent based model for a system of cooperative agents aiming at growth is proposed.This is based on a set of generalized Verhulst-Lotka-Volterra differential equations. In this study, strong cooperation is allowed among agents having similar sizes, and weak cooperation if agents have markedly different “sizes”, thus establishing a peer-to-peer modulated interaction scheme. A rigorous analysis of the stable configurations is presented first examining the fixed points of the system, next determining their stability as a function of the model parameters. It is found that the agents are self-organizing into clusters. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, depending on parameter values, multiple stable configurations can coexist. It occurs that only one of them always emergeswith probability close to one, because its associated attractor dominates over the rest. This is shown through numerical integrations and simulations, after analytic developments. In contrast to the competitive case, agents are able to increase their capacity beyond the no-interaction case limit. In other words, when some collaborative partnership among a relatively small number of partners takes place, all agents act in good faith prioritizing the common good, when receiving a mutual benefit allowing them to surpass their capacity.},

In contrast to the prediction of scale-free network models, however, we find that the most connected cities are not necessarily the most central, resulting in anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multicommunity structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints and that geopolitical considerations have to be taken into account. We identify each city's global role based on its pattern of intercommunity and intracommunity connections, which enables us to obtain scale-specific representations of the network.},

We show that, on realistic random graph models, we can perform this task in time {\$}|E|{\^{}}{\{}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}+o(1){\}}{\$} with high probability, obtaining a significant speedup with respect to the {\$}\backslashTheta(|E|){\$} worst-case performance.

This approach decreases the total number of shortest paths that need to be sampled to compute all betweenness centralities with a given absolute error, and it also handles more general problems, such as computing the {\$}k{\$} most central nodes.

abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.},

Evolution of the spectral density, $\rho$($\lambda$), of the adjacency matrix with increasing $\mu$ leads to the formation of a multizonal support for $\mu${\textgreater}$\mu$c. Eigenvalue tunneling from the central zone to the side one means formation of a new clique in the defragmentation process. The adjacency matrix of the network ground state has a block-diagonal form, where the number of vertices in blocks fluctuates around the mean value Np. The spectral density of the whole network in this regime has triangular shape.

Such deletions include, for example, the failure of Internet routers or power transmission lines. Percolation models on random graphs provide a simple representation of this process but have typically been limited to graphs with Poisson degree distribution at their vertices. Such graphs are quite unlike real-world networks, which often possess power-law or other highly skewed degree distributions. In this paper we study percolation on graphs with completely general degree distribution, giving exact solutions for a variety of cases, including site percolation, bond percolation, and models in which occupation probabilities depend on vertex degree.

abstract = {We elaborate on a linear-time implementation of Collective-Influence (CI) algorithm introduced by Morone, Makse, Nature 524, 65 (2015) to find the minimal set of influencers in networks via optimal percolation. The computational complexity of CI is O(N log N) when removing nodes one-by-one, made possible through an appropriate data structure to process CI. We introduce two Belief-Propagation (BP) variants of CI that consider global optimization via message-passing: CI propagation (CI P ) and Collective-Immunization-Belief-Propagation algorithm (CI BP ) based on optimal immunization. Both identify a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI and, remarkably, reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold obtained in Random Struct. Alg. 21, 397 (2002) for cubic random regular graphs, leaving little room for improvement for random graphs. However, the small augmented performance comes at the expense of increasing running time to O(N 2 ), rendering BP prohibitive for modern-day big-data. For instance, for big-data social networks of 200 million users (e.g., Twitter users sending 500 million tweets/day), CI finds influencers in 2.5 hours on a single CPU, while all BP algorithms (CI P , CI BP and BDP) would take more than 3,000 years to accomplish the same task.},

We present a new method for hierarchical$\backslash$nclustering of data called mutual information clustering (MIC) algorithm.$\backslash$nIt uses mutual information (MI) as a similarity measure and exploits$\backslash$nits grouping property: The MI between three objects X, Y, and Z is$\backslash$nequal to the sum of the MI between X and Y , plus the MI between$\backslash$nZ and the combined object (XY ). Results: We use this both in the$\backslash$nShannon (probabilistic) version of information theory, where the$\backslash$n"objects" are probability distributions represented by random samples,$\backslash$nand in the Kolmogorov (algorithmic) version, where the "objects"$\backslash$nare symbol sequences. We apply our method to the construction of$\backslash$nmammal phylogenetic trees from mitochondrial DNA sequences and we$\backslash$nreconstruct the fetal ECG from the output of independent components$\backslash$nanalysis (ICA) applied to the ECG of a pregnant woman.

abstract = {The statistical mechanical approach to complex networks is the dominant paradigm in describing natural and societal complex systems. The study of network properties, and their implications on dynamical processes, mostly focus on locally defined quantities of nodes and edges, such as node degrees, edge weights and --more recently-- correlations between neighboring nodes. However, statistical methods quickly become cumbersome when dealing with many-body properties and do not capture the precise mesoscopic structure of complex networks. Here we introduce a novel method, based on persistent homology, to detect particular non-local structures, akin to weighted holes within the link-weight network fabric, which are invisible to existing methods. Their properties divide weighted networks in two broad classes: one is characterized by small hierarchically nested holes, while the second displays larger and longer living inhomogeneities. These classes cannot be reduced to known local or quasilocal network properties, because of the intrinsic non-locality of homological properties, and thus yield a new classification built on high order coordination patterns. Our results show that topology can provide novel insights relevant for many-body interactions in social and spatial networks. Moreover, this new method creates the first bridge between network theory and algebraic topology, which will allow to import the toolset of algebraic methods to complex systems.},

abstract = {Why are most empirical networks, with the prominent exception of social ones, generically degree-degree anticorrelated, i.e. disassortative? With a view to answering this long-standing question, we define a general class of degree-degree correlated networks and obtain the associated Shannon entropy as a function of parameters. It turns out that the maximum entropy does not typically correspond to uncorrelated networks, but to either assortative (correlated) or disassortative (anticorrelated) ones. More specifically, for highly heterogeneous (scale-free) networks, the maximum entropy principle usually leads to disassortativity, providing a parsimonious explanation to the question above. Furthermore, by comparing the correlations measured in some real-world networks with those yielding maximum entropy for the same degree sequence, we find a remarkable agreement in various cases. Our approach provides a neutral model from which, in the absence of further knowledge regarding network evolution, one can obtain the expected value of correlations. In cases in which empirical observations deviate from the neutral predictions -- as happens in social networks -- one can then infer that there are specific correlating mechanisms at work.},

Since a precise notion of what constitutes a community has remained evasive, community detection algorithms have often been compared on benchmark graphs with a particular form of community structure, and classified based on the mathematical techniques they employ. However, this can be misleading because apparent similarities in their mathematical machinery can disguise entirely different objectives. Here we provide a focused review of the different motivations that underpin community detection. This problem-driven classification is useful in applied network science, where it is important to select an appropriate algorithm for the given purpose. Moreover, highlighting the different facets of community detection also delineates the many lines of research, and points out open directions and avenues for future research.},

Percolation describes the transition to extensive connectedness upon the gradual addition of links. Whether single links may explosively change macroscopic connectivity in networks where, according to certain rules, links are added competitively has been debated intensely in the past three years. In a recent article [O. Riordan and L. Warnke, Explosive Percolation is Continuous, Science 333, 322 (2011).], O. Riordan and L. Warnke conclude that (i) any rule based on picking a fixed number of random vertices gives a continuous transition, and (ii) that explosive percolation is continuous. In contrast, we show that it is equally true that certain percolation processes based on picking a fixed number of random vertices are discontinuous, and we resolve this apparent paradox. We identify and analyze a process that is continuous in the sense defined by Riordan andWarnke but still exhibits infinitely many discontinuous jumps in an arbitrary vicinity of the transition point: a Devil's staircase. We demonstrate analytically that continuity at the first connectivity transition and discontinuity of the percolation process are compatible for certain competitive percolation systems.},

RNGs belong to the family of "proximity graphs"; i.e., their edgeset encodes proximity information regarding the close neighbors for the terminal nodes of a given edge. Therefore they are, e.g., discussed in the context of the construction of backbones for wireless ad hoc networks that guarantee connectedness of all underlying nodes. Here, by means of numerical simulations, we determine the asymptotic degree and diameter of RNGs and we estimate their bond and site percolation thresholds, which were previously conjectured to be nontrivial. We compare the results to regular 2D graphs for which the degree is close to that of the RNG. Finally, we deduce the common percolation critical exponents from the RNG data to verify that the associated universality class is that of standard 2D percolation. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

The proposed model introduces a two-step mechanism of attachment and triad formation that illustrates how preferential linkage plays an important role in shaping the inhomogeneity of connections and the division of the network into groups of nodes (i.e., the growth of community structures). In particular, we identify conditions under which the scaling exponent of the power law correlates to a widely-used modularity measure of non-overlapping communities. Our analytical results characterize the asymptotic behavior of both the scaling exponent and the modularity, as a function of the strength with which nodes with similar characteristics tend to link to each other. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract = {We define shell l in a network as the set of nodes at distance l with respect to a given node and define rl as the fraction of nodes outside shell l . In a transport process, information or disease usually diffuses from a random node and reach nodes shell after shell. Thus, understanding the shell structure is crucial for the study of the transport property of networks. We study the statistical properties of the shells of a randomly chosen node. For a randomly connected network with given degree distribution, we derive analytically the degree distribution and average degree of the nodes residing outside shell l as a function of rl. Further, we find that rl follows an iterative functional form rl=phi(rl-1) , where phi is expressed in terms of the generating function of the original degree distribution of the network. Our results can explain the power-law distribution of the number of nodes Bl found in shells with l larger than the network diameter d , which is the average distance between all pairs of nodes. For real-world networks the theoretical prediction of rl deviates from the empirical rl. We introduce a network correlation function c(rl) identical with rl/phi(rl-1) to characterize the correlations in the network, where rl is the empirical value and phi(rl-1) is the theoretical prediction. c(rl)=1 indicates perfect agreement between empirical results and theory. We apply c(rl) to several model and real-world networks. We find that the networks fall into two distinct classes: (i) a class of poorly connected networks with c(rl){\textgreater}1 , where a larger (smaller) fraction of nodes resides outside (inside) distance l from a given node than in randomly connected networks with the same degree distributions. Examples include the Watts-Strogatz model and networks characterizing human collaborations such as citation networks and the actor collaboration network; (ii) a class of well-connected networks with c(rl){\textless}1 . Examples include the Barab{\'{a}}si-Albert model and the autonomous system Internet network.},

abstract = {For a network formed by nodes and undirected links between pairs of nodes, the network optimal attack problem aims at deleting a minimum number of target nodes to break the network down into many small components. This problem is intrinsically related to the feedback vertex set problem that was successfully tackled by spin glass theory and an associated belief propagation-guided decimation (BPD) algorithm [H.-J. Zhou, Eur. Phys. J. B 86 (2013) 455]. In the present work we apply the BPD alrogithm (which has approximately linear time complexity) to the network optimal attack problem, and demonstrate that it has much better performance than a recently proposed Collective Information algorithm [F. Morone and H. A. Makse, Nature 524 (2015) 63--68] for different types of random networks and real-world network instances. The BPD-guided attack scheme often induces an abrupt collapse of the whole network, which may make it very difficult to defend.},

Teleportation enables ergodic solutions, but the solutions must necessarily depend on the exact implementation and parametrization of the teleportation. For example, in the commonly used PageRank algorithm, the teleportation rate must trade off a heavily biased solution with a uniform solution. Here we show that teleportation to links rather than nodes enables a much smoother trade-off and effectively more robust results. We also show that, by not recording the teleportation steps of the random walker, we can further reduce the effect of teleportation with dramatic effects on clustering.},

abstract = {Many community detection algorithms have been developed to uncover the mesoscopic properties of complex networks. However how good an algorithm is, in terms of accuracy and computing time, remains still open. Testing algorithms on real-world network has certain restrictions which made their insights potentially biased: the networks are usually small, and the underlying communities are not defined objectively. In this study, we employ the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark graph to test eight state-of-the-art algorithms. We quantify the accuracy using complementary measures and algorithms' computing time. Based on simple network properties and the aforementioned results, we provide guidelines that help to choose the most adequate community detection algorithm for a given network. Moreover, these rules allow uncovering limitations in the use of specific algorithms given macroscopic network properties. Our contribution is threefold: firstly, we provide actual techniques to determine which is the most suited algorithm in most circumstances based on observable properties of the network under consideration. Secondly, we use the mixing parameter as an easily measurable indicator of finding the ranges of reliability of the different algorithms. Finally, we study the dependency with network size focusing on both the algorithm's predicting power and the effective computing time.},

abstract = {Uniform sampling from graphical realizations of a given degree sequence is a fundamental component in simulation-based measurements of network observables, with applications ranging from epidemics, through social networks to Internet modeling. Existing graph sampling methods are either link-swap based (Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithms) or stub-matching based (the Configuration Model). Both types are ill-controlled, with typically unknown mixing times for link-swap methods and uncontrolled rejections for the Configuration Model. Here we propose an efficient, polynomial time algorithm that generates statistically independent graph samples with a given, arbitrary, degree sequence. The algorithm provides a weight associated with each sample, allowing the observable to be measured either uniformly over the graph ensemble, or, alternatively, with a desired distribution. Unlike other algorithms, this method always produces a sample, without back-tracking or rejections.

As examples, we apply our algorithm to generate networks with degree sequences drawn from power-law distributions and from binomial distributions.},

abstract = {A classic problem in population and evolutionary biology is to understand how a population optimizes its fitness in fluctuating environments. A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

We define a new edge centrality measure, called bridgeness, to quantify the importance of a bridge in damaging a network. We find that certain real networks have very large average and variance of bridgeness compared to their degree-preserving randomizations and other real networks.

In the last few years, researchers have made important steps toward understanding the qualitatively new critical phenomena in complex networks. We review the results, concepts, and methods of this rapidly developing field. Here we mostly consider two closely related classes of these critical phenomena, namely structural phase transitions in the network architectures and transitions in cooperative models on networks as substrates. We also discuss systems where a network and interacting agents on it influence each other. We overview a wide range of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the birth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation, phenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical phenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and self-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks. We also discuss strong finite size effects in these systems and highlight open problems and perspectives.},

@article{Gillesple1977,
abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the “reaction-rate equations”); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the “master equation”). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

Such graphs of interaction are in fact shared by a number of biological and technological networks, which have been shown to display a very high homeostasis against random removals of nodes. Here we analyse the response of these ecological graphs to both random and selective perturbations (directed to most connected species). Our results suggest that ecological networks are extremely robust against random removal but very fragile when selective attacks are used. These observations can have important consequences for biodiversity dynamics and conservation issues, current estimations of extinction rates and the relevance and definition of keystone species.},

abstract = {Challenges due to the rapid urbanization of the world -- especially in emerging countries -- range from an increasing dependence on energy, to air pollution, socio-spatial inequalities, environmental and sustainability issues. Modelling the structure and evolution of cities is therefore critical because policy makers need robust theories and new paradigms for mitigating these problems. Fortunately, the increased data available about urban systems opens the possibility of constructing a quantitative 'science of cities', with the aim of identifying and modelling essential phenomena. Statistical physics plays a major role in this effort by bringing tools and concepts able to bridge theory and empirical results. This article illustrates this point by focusing on fundamental objects in cities: the distribution of the urban population; segregation phenomena and spin-like models; the polycentric transition of the activity organization; energy considerations about mobility and models inspired by gravity and radiation concepts; CO2 emitted by transport; and finally, scaling that describes how various socio-economical and infrastructures evolve when cities grow.},

There a simple model was proposed, which changed slightly the classical percolation process so that the emergence of the spanning cluster is delayed. This slight modification turns out to have a great impact on the percolation phase transition. The resulting transition is so sharp that it was termed explosive, and it was at first considered to be discontinuous. This surprising fact stimulated considerable interest in "Achlioptas processes". Later work, however, showed that the transition is continuous (at least for Achlioptas processes on Erd{\"{o}}s networks), but with very unusual finite size scaling.

abstract = {Complexity develops via the incorporation of innovative properties. Chess is one of the most complex strategy games, where expert contenders exercise decision making by imitating old games or introducing innovations. In this work, we study innovation in chess by analyzing how different move sequences are played at the population level. It is found that the probability of exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency of the preceding move sequence. Chess players also exploit already known move sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth mechanism. Furthermore, innovation in chess exhibits Heaps' law suggesting similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust generative mechanism based on nested Yule-Simon preferential growth processes that reproduces the empirical observations. These results, supporting the self-similar nature of innovations in chess are important in the context of decision making in a competitive scenario, and extend the scope of relevant findings recently discovered regarding the emergence of Zipf's law in chess.},

Using extensive phone records resolved in both time and space, we study the mean collective behavior at large scales and focus on the occurrence of anomalous events. We discuss how these spatiotemporal anomalies can be described using standard percolation theory tools. We also investigate patterns of calling activity at the individual level and show that the interevent time of consecutive calls is heavy-tailed. This finding, which has implications for dynamics of spreading phenomena in social networks, agrees with results previously reported on other human activities.},

abstract = {Hybrid percolation transitions (HPTs) induced by cascading processes have been observed in diverse complex systems such as k-core percolation, breakdown on interdependent networks and cooperative epidemic spreading models. Here we present the microscopic universal mechanism underlying those HPTs. We show that the discontinuity in the order parameter results from two steps: a durable critical branching (CB) and an explosive, supercritical (SC) process, the latter resulting from large loops inevitably present in finite size samples. In a random network of N nodes at the transition the CB process persists for O(N 1/3) time and the remaining nodes become vulnerable, which are then activated in the short SC process. This crossover mechanism and scaling behavior are universal for different HPT systems. Our result implies that the crossover time O(N 1/3) is a golden time, during which one needs to take actions to control and prevent the formation of a macroscopic cascade, e.g., a pandemic outbreak.},

When nodes are described with a set of attributes we have an attributed network. Nodes and their relationships tend to naturally form into communities or clusters, and discovering these communities is paramount to many applications. Evaluating algorithms or comparing algorithms for automatic discovery of communities requires networks with known structures. Synthetic generators of networks have been proposed for this task but most solely focus on connectivity and their properties and overlook attribute values and the network properties vis-{\`{a}}-vis these attributes. In this paper, we propose a new generator for attributed networks with community structure that dependably follows the properties of real world networks.},

Such a balance could be established and maintained in an experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical circuitry.},

abstract = {The dynamic behavior of a multiagent system in which the agent size si is variable it is studied along a Lotka-Volterra approach. The agent size has hereby the meaning of the fraction of a given market that an agent is able to capture (market share). A Lotka-Volterra system of equations for prey-predator problems is considered, the competition factor being related to the difference in size between the agents in a one-on-one competition. This mechanism introduces a natural self-organized dynamic competition among agents. In the competition factor, a parameter $\sigma$ is introduced for scaling the intensity of agent size similarity, which varies in each iteration cycle. The fixed points of this system are analytically found and their stability analyzed for small systems (with n = 5 agents). We have found that different scenarios are possible, from chaotic to non-chaotic motion with cluster formation as function of the $\sigma$ parameter and depending on the initial conditions imposed to the system. The present contribution aim is to show how a realistic though minimalist nonlinear dynamics model can be used to describe the market competition (companies, brokers, decision makers) among other opinion maker communities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We construct a block-based model which incorporates--in a general fashion--both connectivity and interdependence links, as well as arbitrary degree distributions and block correlations. By optimizing the percolation properties of this general class of networks, we identify a simple core-periphery structure as the topology most robust against random failure. In such networks, a distinct and small "core" of nodes with higher degree is responsible for most of the connectivity, functioning as a central "backbone" of the system. This centralized topology remains the optimal structure when other constraints are imposed, such as a given fraction of interdependence links and fixed degree distributions. This distinguishes simple centralized topologies as the most likely to emerge, when robustness against failure is the dominant evolutionary force.},

abstract = {This paper presents an extensive survey of regular distributions in natural and social sciences. The survey includes studies from a wide scope of academic disciplines, in order to create an inventory of the different mathematical functions used to describe the distributions. The goal of the study was to determine, whether a unique function can be used to describe all the distributions (universality) or a particular function is best suited to describe the distributions in each specific field of research (domain universality). We propose a classification of distributions into eighth different categories, based on three representations: the Zipf representation, the cumulative density function (CDF) and the probability density function (PDF). In the 89 cases included in the survey, neither universality nor domain universality was found. In particular, based on the results of the survey, the claim that "power law provides a good description for majority of distributions" may be rejected. Only one third of the distributions in our survey are associated with power laws, while another third is well described by lognormal and similar functions (Dagum, Weibull, loglogistic and Gamma functions). We suggest that correct characterization of a distribution relies on two conditions. First, it is important to include the full range of the available data to avoid distortion due to arbitrary cut off values. Second, it is advisable to display the data in all three representations: the Zipf representation, the CDF and the PDF.},

Modularity had been shown to have an important effect on the evolution and stability of biological networks, on the scalability and efficiency of large-scale infrastructure, and the development of economic and social systems. An analytical framework for understanding modularity and its effects on network vulnerability is still missing. Through recent advances in the understanding of multilayer networks, however, it is now possible to develop a theoretical framework to systematically study this critical issue. Here we study, analytically and numerically, the resilience of modular networks under attacks on interconnected nodes, which exhibit high betweenness values and are often more exposed to failure. Our model provides new understandings into the feedback between structure and function in real world systems, and consequently has important implications as diverse as developing efficient immunization strategies, designing robust large-scale infrastructure, and understanding brain function.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Usually, the existence of a complex network is considered an advantage feature and efforts are made to increase its robustness against an attack. However, there exist also harmful and/or malicious networks, from social ones like spreading hoax, corruption, phishing, extremist ideology, and terrorist support up to computer networks spreading computer viruses or DDoS attack software or even biological networks of carriers or transport centers spreading disease among the population. New attack strategy can be therefore used against malicious networks, as well as in a worst-case scenario test for robustness of a useful network. A common measure of robustness of networks is their disintegration level after removal of a fraction of nodes. This robustness can be calculated as a ratio of the number of nodes of the greatest remaining network component against the number of nodes in the original network. Our paper presents a combination of heuristics optimized for an attack on a complex network to achieve its greatest disintegration. Nodes are deleted sequentially based on a heuristic criterion. Efficiency of classical attack approaches is compared to the proposed approach on Barab{\'{a}}si-Albert, scale-free with tunable power-law exponent, and Erdős-R{\'{e}}nyi models of complex networks and on real-world networks.

abstract = {Complex networks are everywhere, such as the power grid network, the airline network, the protein-protein interaction network, and the road network. The networks are 'robust yet fragile', which means that the networks are robust against random failures but fragile under malicious attacks. The cascading failures, system-wide disasters and intentional attacks on these networks are deserving of in-depth study. Researchers have proposed many solutions to improve the robustness of these networks. However whilst many solutions preserve the degree distribution of the networks, little attention is paid to the community structure of these networks. We argue that the community structure of a network is a defining characteristic of a network which identifies its functionality and thus should be preserved. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between robustness and the community structure. Then we propose a 3-step strategy to improve the robustness of a network, while retaining its community structure, and also its degree distribution. With extensive experimentation on representative real-world networks, we demonstrate that our method is effective and can greatly improve the robustness of networks, while preserving community structure and degree distribution. Finally, we give a description of a robust network, which is useful not only for improving robustness, but also for designing robust networks and integrating networks.},

abstract = {Networks that are fragmented into small disconnected components are prevalent in a large variety of systems. These include the secure communication networks of commercial enterprises, government agencies and illicit organizations, as well as networks that suffered multiple failures, attacks or epidemics. The properties of such networks resemble those of subcritical random networks, which consist of finite components, whose sizes are non-extensive. Surprisingly, such networks do not exhibit the small-world property that is typical in supercritical random networks, where the mean distance between pairs of nodes scales logarithmically with the network size. Unlike supercritical networks whose structure has been studied extensively, subcritical networks have attracted little attention. A special feature of these networks is that the statistical and geometric properties vary between different components and depend on their sizes and topologies. The overall statistics of the network can be obtained by a summation over all the components with suitable weights. We use a topological expansion to perform a systematic analysis of the degree distribution and the distribution of shortest path lengths (DSPL) on components of given sizes and topologies in subcritical Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks. From this expansion we obtain an exact analytical expression for the DSPL of the entire subcritical network, in the asymptotic limit. The DSPL, which accounts for all the pairs of nodes that reside on the same finite component (FC), is found to follow a geometric distribution of the form {\$}P{\_}{\{}\backslashrm FC{\}}(L=\backslashell|L{\textless}\backslashinfty)=(1-c)c{\^{}}{\{}\backslashell-1{\}}{\$}, where {\$}c{\textless}1{\$} is the mean degree. We confirm the convergence to this asymptotic result using computer simulations. Using the duality relations between subcritical and supercritical ER networks, we obtain the DSPL on the non-giant components above the percolation transition.},

abstract = {Random planar graphs appear in a variety of contexts and it is important for many different applications to be able to characterize their structure. Local quantities fail to give interesting information and it seems that path-related measures are able to convey relevant information about the organization of these structures. In particular, nodes with a large betweenness centrality (BC) display nontrivial patterns, such as central loops. We first discuss empirical results for different random planar graphs and we then propose a toy model which allows us to discuss the condition for the emergence of nontrivial patterns such as central loops. This toy model is made of a star network with Nb branches of size n and links of weight 1, superimposed to a loop at distance ℓ from the center and with links of weight w. We estimate for this model the BC at the center and on the loop and we show that the loop can be more central than the origin if w{\textless}wc where the threshold of this transition scales as wc∼n/Nb. In this regime, there is an optimal position of the loop that scales as ℓopt∼Nbw/4. This simple model sheds some light on the organization of these random structures and allows us to discuss the effect of randomness on the centrality of loops. In particular, it suggests that the number and the spatial extension of radial branches are the crucial ingredients that control the existence of central loops.},

abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.},

Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g. ‘circles' on Google+, and ‘lists' on Facebook and Twitter), however they are laborious to construct and must be updated when- ever a user's network grows. We define a novel machine learning task of identi- fying users' social circles. We pose the problem as a node clustering problem on a user's ego-network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user pro- file information. For each circle we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles. Experiments show that our model accurately identifies circles on a diverse set of data from Facebook, Google+, and Twitter for all of which we obtain hand-labeled ground-truth},

We also study SIR-type epidemic processes within the model and find that clustering decreases the size of epidemics, but also decreases the epidemic threshold, making it easier for diseases to spread. In addition, clustering causes epidemics to saturate sooner, meaning that they infect a near-maximal fraction of the network for quite low transmission rates.},

Here, we consider the history of the entire market and analyse the behaviour of 1,469 cryptocurrencies introduced between April 2013 and June 2017. We reveal that, while new cryptocurrencies appear and disappear continuously and their market capitalization is increasing (super-)exponentially, several statistical properties of the market have been stable for years. These include the number of active cryptocurrencies, the market share distribution and the turnover of cryptocurrencies. Adopting an ecological perspective, we show that the so-called neutral model of evolution is able to reproduce a number of key empirical observations, despite its simplicity and the assumption of no selective advantage of one cryptocurrency over another. Our results shed light on the properties of the cryptocurrency market and establish a first formal link between ecological modelling and the study of this growing system. We anticipate they will spark further research in this direction.},

abstract = {Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical networks. Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.},

abstract = {We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networks-natural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups. Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible "betweenness" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

abstract = {We investigate the influence of the range of interactions in the two-dimensional bond percolation model by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We locate the phase transitions for several interaction ranges, as expressed by the number z of equivalent neighbors. We also consider the z→∞ limit, i.e., the complete graph case, where percolation bonds are allowed between each pair of sites, and the model becomes mean-field-like. All investigated models with finite z are found to belong to the short-range universality class. There is no evidence of a tricritical point separating the short-range and long-range behavior, such as is known to occur for q=3 and q=4 Potts models. We determine the renormalization exponent describing a finite-range perturbation at the mean-field limit as yr≈2/3. Its relevance confirms the continuous crossover from mean-field percolation universality to short-range percolation universality. For finite interaction ranges, we find approximate relations between the coordination numbers and the amplitudes of the leading correction terms as found in the finite-size scaling analysis.},

Let L($\Gamma$)=D(G)-A($\Gamma$), be the Laplacian of $\Gamma$ and $\lambda$1≥$\lambda$2≥{\^{a}}̄≥ $\lambda$n≥0 be its eigenvalues. It is well-known that a signed graph $\Gamma$ is balanced if and only if $\lambda$n($\Gamma$)=0. Here we show that, if $\Gamma$ is unbalanced, then $\lambda$n estimates how much $\Gamma$ is far from being balanced. In particular, let $\nu$($\Gamma$) (resp. {\"{I}}$\mu$($\Gamma$)) be the frustration number (resp. frustration index), that is the minimum number of vertices (resp. edges) to be deleted such that the signed graph is balanced. Then we prove that$\lambda$n($\Gamma$) ≤$\nu$($\Gamma$)≤{\"{I}}$\mu$($\Gamma$). Further we analyze the case when $\lambda$n($\Gamma$)=$\nu$($\Gamma$). In the latter setting, we identify the structure of the underlying graph G and we give an algebraic condition for L($\Gamma$) which leads to the above equality. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cluster analysis is an unsupervised process that divides a set of objects into homogeneous groups. This book starts with basic information on cluster analysis, including the classification of data and the corresponding similarity measures, followed by the presentation of over 50 clustering algorithms in groups according to some specific baseline methodologies such as hierarchical, center-based, and search-based methods. As a result, readers and users can easily identify an appropriate algorithm for their applications and compare novel ideas with existing results. The book also provides examples of clustering applications to illustrate the advantages and shortcomings of different clustering architectures and algorithms. Application areas include pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, information technology, image processing, biology, psychology, and marketing. Readers also learn how to perform cluster analysis with the C/C++ and MATLAB programming languages.Audience The following groups will find this book a valuable tool and reference: applied statisticians; engineers and scientists using data analysis; researchers in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data mining; and applied mathematicians. Instructors can also use it as a textbook for an introductory course in cluster analysis or as source material for a graduate-level introduction to data mining.},

abstract = {An articulation point in a network is a node whose removal disconnects the network. Those nodes play key roles in ensuring connectivity of many real-world networks, from infrastructure networks to protein interaction networks and terrorist communication networks. Despite their fundamental importance, a general framework of studying articulation points in complex networks is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study key issues pertinent to articulation points, e.g. the expected number of them and the network vulnerability against their removal, in an arbitrary complex network. We find that a greedy articulation point removal process provides us a novel perspective on the organizational principles of complex networks. Moreover, this process is associated with two fundamentally different types of percolation transitions with a rich phase diagram. Our results shed light on the design of more resilient infrastructure networks and the effective destruction of terrorist communication networks.},

We present optimized implementations, available from http://cain.sourceforge.net/, that offer better performance than previous work. There is no single method that is best for all problems. Simple formulations often work best for systems with a small number of reactions, while some sophisticated methods offer the best performance for large problems and scale well asymptotically. We investigate the performance of each formulation on simple biological systems using a wide range of problem sizes. We also consider the numerical accuracy of the direct and the next reaction method. We have found that special precautions must be taken in order to ensure that randomness is not discarded during the course of a simulation.},

To illustrate the techniques and support our findings using Monte Carlo simulations, we introduce the exemplary linking rule pk proportional to k-$\alpha$, with $\alpha$ between -1 and plus infinity. This parameter may be used to interpolate between different regimes. For negative $\alpha$, links are most likely attached to high-degree nodes.

As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},
